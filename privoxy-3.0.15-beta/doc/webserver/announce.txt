              Announcing Privoxy v.3.0.15 beta
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Privoxy 3.0.15 beta is a bugfix-release for the previous betas
which introduced IPv6 support, improved keep-alive support and
a bunch of minor improvements.

See http://www.privoxy.org/3.0.14/user-manual/whatsnew.html for details.

ChangeLog for Privoxy
--------------------------------------------------------------------
*** Version 3.0.15 beta ***

- In case of missing server data, no error message is send to the
  client if the request arrived on a reused connection. The client
  is then supposed to silently retry the request without bothering
  the user. This should significantly reduce the frequency of the
  "No server or forwarder data received" error message many users
  reported.
- More reliable detection of prematurely closed client sockets
  with keep-alive enabled.
- FEATURE_CONNECTION_KEEP_ALIVE is decoupled from
  FEATURE_CONNECTION_SHARING and now available on
  all platforms.
- Improved handling of POST requests on reused connections.
  Should fix problems with stalled connections after submitting
  form data with some browser configurations.
- Fixed various latency calculation issues.
- Allows the client to pass NTLM authentication requests to a
  forwarding proxy. This was already assumed and hinted to work
  in 3.0.13 beta but actually didn't. Now it's confirmed to work
  with IE, Firefox and Chrome.
  Thanks to Francois Botha and Wan-Teh Chang
- Fixed a calculation problem if receiving the server headers
  takes more than two reads, that could cause Privoxy to terminate
  the connection prematurely. Reported by Oliver.
- Compiles again on platforms such as OpenBSD and systems
  using earlier glibc version that don't support AI_ADDRCONFIG.
  Anonymously submitted in #2872591.
- A bunch of MS VC project files and Suse and Redhat RPM spec
  files have been removed as they were no longer maintained for
  quite some time.
- Overly long action lines are properly rejected with a proper
  error message. Previously they would be either rejected as
  invalid or cause a core dump through abort().
- Already timed-out connections are no longer temporarily remembered.
  They weren't reused anyway, but wasted a socket slot.
- len refers to the number of bytes actually read which might
  differ from the ones received. Adjust log messages accordingly.
- The optional JavaScript on the CGI page uses encodeURIComponent()
  instead of escape() which doesn't encode all characters that matter.
  Anonymously reported in #2832722.
- Fix gcc45 warnings in decompress_iob().
- Various log message improvements.
- Privoxy-Regression-Test supports redirect tests.
- Privoxy-Log-Parser can gather some connection statistics.

*** Version 3.0.14 beta ***

- The latency is taken into account when evaluating whether or not to
  reuse a connection. This should significantly reduce the number of
  connections problems several users reported.
- If the server doesn't specify how long the connection stays alive,
  Privoxy errs on the safe side of caution and assumes it's only a second.
- The error pages for connection timeouts or missing server data use a
  Last-Modified date in the past. Retry attempts are detected and Privoxy
  removes the If-Modified-Since header to prevent the server from responding
  with status code 304 in which case the client would reuse the error message.
- Setting keep-alive-timeout to 0 disables keep-alive support. Previously
  Privoxy would claim to allow persistence but not reuse the connection.
- Pipelined requests are less likely to be mistaken for the request
  body of the previous request. Note that Privoxy still has no real
  pipeline support and will either serialize pipelined requests or
  drop them in which case the client has to resent them.
- Fixed a crash on some Windows versions when header randomization
  is enabled and the date couldn't be parsed.
- Privoxy's keep-alive timeout for the current connection is reduced
  to the one specified in the client's Keep-Alive header.
- For HTTP/1.1 requests, Privoxy implies keep-alive support by not
  setting any Connection header instead of using 'Connection: keep-alive'.
- If the socket isn't reusable, Privoxy doesn't temporarily waste
  a socket slot to remember the connection.
- If keep-alive support is disabled but compiled in, the client's
  Keep-Alive header is removed.
- Fixed a bug on mingw32 where downloading large files failed if
  keep-alive support was enabled.
- Fixed a bug that (at least theoretically) could cause log
  timestamps to be occasionally off by about a second.
- No Proxy-Connection header if added if there already is one.
- The configure script respects the $PATH variable when searching
  for groups and id.

*** Version 3.0.13 beta  ***

- Added IPv6 support. Thanks to Petr Pisar who not only provided
  the initial patch but also helped a lot with the integration.
- Added client-side keep-alive support.
- The connection sharing code is only used if the connection-sharing
  option is enabled.
- The max-client-connections option has been added to restrict
  the number of client connections below a value enforced by
  the operating system.
- Fixed a regression reintroduced in 3.0.12 that could cause
  crashes on mingw32 if header date randomization was enabled.
- Compressed content with extra fields couldn't be decompressed
  and would get passed to the client unfiltered. This problem
  has only be detected through statical analysis with clang as
  nobody seems to be using extra fields anyway.
- If the server resets the Connection after sending only the headers
  Privoxy forwards what it got to the client. Previously Privoxy
  would deliver an error message instead.
- Error messages in case of connection timeouts use the right
  HTTP status code.
- If spawning a child to handle a request fails, the client
  gets an error message and Privoxy continues to listen for
  new requests right away.
- The error messages in case of server-connection timeouts or
  prematurely closed server connections are now template-based.
- If zlib support isn't compiled in, Privoxy no longer tries to
  filter compressed content unless explicitly asked to do so.
- In case of connections that are denied based on ACL directives,
  the memory used for the client IP is no longer leaked.
- Fixed another small memory leak if the client request times out
  while waiting for client headers other than the request line.
- The client socket is kept open until the server socket has
  been marked as unused. This should increase the chances that
  the still-open connection will be reused for the client's next
  request to the same destination. Note that this only matters
  if connection-sharing is enabled.
- A TODO list has been added to the source tarballs to give potential
  volunteers a better idea of what the current goals are.

About Privoxy:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Privoxy is a non-caching web proxy with advanced filtering capabilities for
enhancing privacy, modifying web page data and HTTP headers, controlling
access, and removing ads and other obnoxious Internet junk. Privoxy has a
flexible configuration and can be customized to suit individual needs and
tastes. It has application for both stand-alone systems and multi-user
networks.

Privoxy is Free Software and licensed under the GPL2.

Privoxy is an associated project of Software in the Public Interest (SPI).

At present, Privoxy is known to run on Windows(95, 98, ME, 2000,
XP, Vista), Linux (Ubuntu, RedHat, SuSE, Debian, Fedora, Gentoo and
others), Mac OSX, OS/2, AmigaOS, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, and
various other flavors of Unix.

In addition to the core features of ad blocking and cookie management,
Privoxy provides many supplemental features, that give the end-user
more control, more privacy and more freedom:


    *  Supports "Connection: keep-alive". Outgoing connections can be kept
       alive independently from the client. Currently not available on all
       platforms.

    *  Supports IPv6, provided the operating system does so too,
       and the configure script detects it.

    *  Supports tagging which allows to change the behaviour based on client
       and server headers.

    *  Can be run as an "intercepting" proxy, which obviates the need to
       configure browsers individually.

    *  Sophisticated actions and filters for manipulating both server and
       client headers.

    *  Can be chained with other proxies.

    *  Integrated browser based configuration and control utility at
       http://config.privoxy.org/ (shortcut: http://p.p/). Browser-based
       tracing of rule and filter effects. Remote toggling.

    *  Web page filtering (text replacements, removes banners based on size,
       invisible <quote>web-bugs</quote> and HTML annoyances, etc.)

    *  Modularized configuration that allows for standard settings and user
       settings to reside in separate files, so that installing updated actions
       files won't overwrite individual user settings.

    *  Support for Perl Compatible Regular Expressions in the configuration
       files, and a more sophisticated and flexible configuration syntax.

    *  GIF de-animation.

    *  Bypass many click-tracking scripts (avoids script redirection).

    *  User-customizable HTML templates for most proxy-generated pages (e.g.
       "blocked" page).

    *  Auto-detection and re-reading of config file changes.
    
    *  Most features are controllable on a per-site or per-location basis.
