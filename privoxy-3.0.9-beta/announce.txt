                 Announcing Privoxy v.3.0.9 Beta
-----------------------------------------------------------------

3.0.9 is a beta release which includes many enhancements but no major 
new features. The most prominent improvements are SOCKS5 support and 
zlib support for the default Privoxy builds.

See http://www.privoxy.org/3.0.9/user-manual/whatsnew.html for details.

ChangeLog for Privoxy
--------------------------------------------------------------------
*** Version 3.0.9 Beta ***

- Added SOCKS5 support (with address resolution done by
  the SOCKS5 server). Patch provided by Eric M. Hopper.
- The "blocked" CGI pages include a block reason that was
  provided as argument to the last-applying block action.
- If enable-edit-actions is disabled (the default since 3.0.7 beta)
  the show-status page hides the edit buttons and explains why.
  Previously the user would get the "this feature has been disabled"
  message after using the edit button.
- Forbidden CONNECT requests are treated like blocks by default.
  The now-pointless treat-forbidden-connects-like-blocks action
  has been removed.
- Not enabling limit-connect now allows CONNECT requests to all ports.
  In previous versions it would only allow CONNECT requests to port 443.
  Use +limit-connect{443} if you think you need the old default behaviour.
- The CGI editor gets turned off after three edit requests with invalid
  file modification timestamps. This makes life harder for attackers
  who can leverage browser bugs to send fake Referers and intend to
  brute-force edit URLs.
- Action settings for multiple patterns in the same section are
  shared in memory. As a result these sections take up less space
  (and are loaded slightly faster). Problem reported by Franz Schwartau.
- Linear white space in HTTP headers will be normalized to single
  spaces before parsing the header's content, headers split across
  multiple lines get merged first. This should prevent problems like:
   * letting the session-cookies-only action slip
     some Cookies through unmodified,
   * only suppressing the first line of a header,
     thus creating an invalid one, and
   * to incorrectly block headers with valid timestamps
     that weren't properly recognized.
  Headers that could trigger these problems are unlikely to appear
  in "normal" web traffic, but could be intentionally generated to
  fool some of Privoxy's header parsers.
- Host information is gathered outside the main thread so it's less
  likely to delay other incoming connections if the host is misconfigured.
- New config option "hostname" to use a hostname other than
  the one returned by the operating system. Useful to speed-up responses
  for CGI requests on misconfigured systems. Requested by Max Khon.
- The CGI editor supports the "disable all filters of this type"
  directives "-client-header-filter", "-server-header-filter",
  "-client-header-tagger" and "-server-header-tagger".
- Fixed false-positives with the link-by-url filter and URLs that
  contain the pattern "/jump/".
- The less-download-windows filter no longer messes
  "Content-Type: application/x-shockwave-flash" headers up.
- In the show-url-info page's "Final results" section active and
  inactive actions are listed separately. Patch provided by Lee.
- The GNUmakefile supports the DESTDIR variable. Patch for
  the install target submitted by Radoslaw Zielinski.
- Embedding the content of configuration files in the show-status
  page is significantly faster now. For a largish action file (1 MB)
  a speedup of about 2450 times has been measured. This is mostly
  interesting if you are using large action files or regularly use
  Privoxy-Regression-Test while running Privoxy through Valgrind,
  for stock configuration files it doesn't really matter.
- If zlib support is unavailable and there are content
  filters active but the prevent-compression action is disabled,
  the show-url-info page includes a warning that compression
  might prevent filtering.
- The show-url-info page provides an OpenSearch Description that
  allows to access the page through browser search plugins.
- The obsolete kill-popups action has been removed as the
  PCRS-based popup filters can do the same and are slightly
  less unreliable.
- The inspect-jpegs action has been removed.
- The send-wafer and send-vanilla-wafer actions have been removed.
  They weren't particular useful and their behaviour could be emulated
  with add-header anyway.
- Privoxy-Regression-Test has been significantly improved.
- Most sections in the default.action file contain tests for
  Privoxy-Regression-Test to verify that they are working as intended.
- Parts of Privoxy have been refactored to increase maintainability.
- Building with zlib (if available) is done by default.

About Privoxy:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Privoxy is a web proxy with advanced filtering capabilities for
protecting privacy, modifying web page data, managing cookies,
controlling access, and removing ads, banners, pop-ups and other
obnoxious Internet junk. Privoxy has a very flexible
configuration and can be customized to suit individual needs
and tastes. Privoxy has application for both stand-alone systems
and multi-user networks.

Privoxy is based on Internet Junkbuster (tm).

At present, Privoxy is known to run on Windows(95, 98, ME, 2000,
XP, Vista), Linux (Ubuntu, RedHat, SuSE, Debian, Fedora, Gentoo and
others), Mac OSX, OS/2, AmigaOS, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, and
various other flavors of Unix.

In addition to the traditional features of ad and junk blocking, and cookie
management, Privoxy adds these features:

  * Can be run as an "intercepting" proxy, which obviates the need to
    configure browsers individually.

  * Sophisticated actions and filters for manipulating both server and client
    headers.        

  * Can be chained with other proxies.

  * Integrated browser based configuration and control utility
    at http://config.privoxy.org/ (shortcut: http://p.p/). Browser-based
    tracing of rule and filter effects. Remote toggling.

  * Bypass many click-tracking scripts (avoids script redirection).
   
  * Multi-threaded (POSIX and native threads).
   
  * User-customizable HTML templates for all proxy-generated pages (e.g.
    "blocked" page).
   
  * Auto-detection and re-reading of config file changes.
   
  * Improved signal handling, and a true daemon mode (Unix).
   
  * Every feature now controllable on a per-site or per-location basis,
    configuration more powerful and versatile over-all.
   
  * Many smaller new features added, limitations and bugs removed.
