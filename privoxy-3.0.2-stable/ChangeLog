  is.)
- More CGI actions editor fixes and improvements.
- Win32 command line fix ups.
- re_filterfile now has modular sections that can be activated on a 
  per site basis. Some new goodies there too.
- +filter now takes arguments to match FILTER sections in re_filterfile
  for even more flexibility. 
- Added a new image blocker option: +image-blocker{pattern}, which 
  displays a checkerboard patthern and scales better than the logo.
- PNG images will be used in place of GIF for JB built-in images
  if configured with --enable-no-gif.

*** Version 2.9.3 pre-Alpha Changes ***

- Amiga support (completely untested by me - I don't have an Amiga)
- "tinygif 3" support (redirects blocked images to a specified URL, so
the browser doesn't have to load and cache many copies of the same
image).
- one case where there were both local and global "referrer" variables
(yuck!) clarified by renaming the local one to "refer".
- Fixed some places where close() was used instead of close_socket().
Thanks to Jörg Strohmayer (joergs at users.sourceforge.net) for these.
- Temporary hack to get FORCE_LOAD to work with IE.  I just lowercased the
FORCE_LOAD_PREFIX.  Needs fixing properly.
- Most URLs hardcoded into Junkbuster were changed to go through a script
e.g. http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net/redirect.php?v=2.9.3&to=faq
The only other URLs left are the GNU GPL:
  http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl.html
and the home page:
  http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net/
... and various URLs which will be intercepted by Junkbuster anyway.
TODO: Still need to do something with the URLs in Junkbuster Corp's 
copyright/trademark notice on the bottom of the show-proxy-args page.
- PCRE or GNU Regex is now a #define option.


*** Version 2.9.2 pre-Alpha Changes ***

- Andreas applied the latest version of the FORCE patch.


*** Version 2.9.1 pre-Alpha Changes ***

- in parsers.c, fixed two #ifdef FORCE to #ifdef FORCE_LOAD
(BTW: I think FORCE is precise enough, since loading remote
data is the whole purpose of a proxy..)
- Set the FORCE_PREFIX (back) to 'IJB-FORCE-LOAD-'. While 'noijb.'
is more elegant and looks like a hostname in the URL, it doesn't
make clear to the inexperienced user that the proxy is bypassed. It
also has a higher name collision risk.
- Filled in the function header templates for my functions in
parsers.c (again). They obviously got lost in our current
patch war ;-)
- Cut the credit for the §-referrer-option from the config file,
that Stefan had placed there.
- Improved the re_filterfile 


*** Version 2.9.0 pre-Alpha Changes ***

-  Now use PCRE, not GNU REGEX.  I have not yet had chance to check the
syntax of the block/image/cookie file to ensure that they match what
is expected - however they seem to work.
-  Replaced "configure" script with one generated by "autoconf".  Also 
use a header "config.h" (was ijbconfig.h in my previous release) for 
the #defines.  "config.h" is now generated with "autoheader" from 
"acconfig.h" and "configure.in".  (Note that to install you do not
need autoconf or autoheader - just run "./configure".)
To see command-line options, run "./configure --help".
This is my first ever autoconf script, so it has some rough edges
(how PCRE is handled is the roughest).
-  Error logging code replaced with new module errlog.c, based on the
one from JunkbusterMT (but with the threading code removed).
-  Most of Rodney's 0.21 and 0.21A patches applied. (Marked *).  I did not
apply all of these, since I had already independently done conditional
popup file, conditional image file, and integration of popup code.
- ACL, Jar and trust files conditionally compiled.
- New source file headers.
- Various cosmetic changes.  (But I have not consistently ordered the 
config files - I think that's worthwhile, but it's 1am and I want to
get this released!)
- RCS tags on .h files.
-  RCS tags are const char[] rather than const char *.  (Saves 4 bytes
per tag ;-)
- VC++ project files renamed to vc_junkbuster.*.
- show-proxy-args now shows status of all conditionals, not just REGEX
- Various functions moved around.  Most notably all the system-specific
sockets code which was spread between jcc.c, bind.c, and connect.c,
has been moved to "jbsockets.c".  The non-system-specific code from
connect.c and socks4.c has been movet to "gateway.c".  Also, the
config file loader and the global variables it writes to have been
moved to "loadcfg.c".  (Maybe this should go into loaders.c?)
And candidate for the "worst filename ever" award is "miscutil.c",
which contains, well, miscellaneous utility functions like zalloc.
(Suggestions for a better name for this file are welcome!)
- Loaders now use a common function to read a line and skip comments,
and this function also stores the proxy_args.
- Added ./junkbuster --help     (Not for Win32 GUI)
- Added ./junkbuster --version  (Not for Win32 GUI)
- Win32 resources are now all marked as "U.S. English", rather than
being a mix of "U.S. English", "U.K. English" and "Irish English".
- Version number changes to 2.9.0
