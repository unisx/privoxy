ChangeLog for Privoxy
--------------------------------------------------------------------
*** Since 3.0.6 ***

- Added zlib support to filter content with gzip and deflate
  encoding. (Patch provided by Wil Mahan)
- Dedicated filters and actions are used for header filtering.
  "filter-client-headers" and "filter-client-headers" are no longer
  supported, use server-header-filter{} and client-header-filter{}
  instead.
- Tags can be used to change actions based on HTTP headers.
- New server-header filter: less-download-windows.
- New client-header taggers: css-requests, image-requests,
  client-ip-address, http-method, allow-post, complete-url,
  user-agent and privoxy-control.
- New server-header taggers: content-type and privoxy-control.
- The forward-override{} action allows to change the forwarding
  settings through the action files, for example based on client
  headers like the User-Agent, or the request origin.
- Socks errors are no longer handled by the CGI page for
  DNS resolution failures.
- CGI pages use favicons to signal whether they are error
  or control pages. This is useful if you rely heavily on
  browser tabs.
- The show-url-info CGI page shows the forwarding settings.
- "Crunch!" log messages (used when Privoxy answers requests
  by itself) now also contain the reason.
- Allow to rewrite the request destination behind the client's back.
- Fix socks requests on big-endian platforms. Patch provided by Song Weijia.
- Fixes possible deadlocks and crashes on OpenBSD.
  Patch provided by Ralf Horstmann.
- The CGI action editor allows to edit actionfiles with previously
  forbidden characters like dots.
- New trust entries are saved with a comment that contains the
  trusted referring URL (Suggested by Daniel Griscom).
- Filter descriptions are HTML encoded automatically. 	
- New config option "split-large-forms" to work
  around a browser bug that caused IE6 and IE7 to ignore
  the Submit button on the edit-actions-for-url CGI page.
- New config option "allow-cgi-request-crunching" to allow
  requests for Privoxy's CGI pages to be blocked, redirected
  or (un)trusted like ordinary requests.
- Empty filter files no longer interrupt the filtering process
  prematurely and are correctly listed on the show-status CGI page.
- New config option "accept-intercepted-requests" to combine
  Privoxy with any packet filter to build an intercepting proxy
  for HTTP/1.1 requests (and for HTTP/1.0 requests with Host header set).
- fast-redirects{} catch redirects to https URLs as well.
- redirect{s@foo@bar@} can be used to redirect to a rewritten
  version of the original URL.
- Trap unsupported gopher proxy requests.
- Fixed a bug in the User Manual delivery on Windows
  (mingw32 only). Images now show up correctly and HTML
  pages are no longer padded with garbage data.
- Fixed several minor memory leaks, most of them discovered with Valgrind.
- Only unlink the pidfile if it's actually used.
- Retries after connection problems with forced requests
  aren't blocked again.
- On Unix SIGABRT causes a core dump as expected and is no
  longer treated as normal shutdown signal.
- The "access denied" CGI page is more descriptive and
  allows retries to circumvent the referrer check.
- Updated PCRS to handle unexpected PCRE errors properly.
  Fixed crashes that could occur if Privoxy was build
  with external PCRE versions newer than Privoxy's internal
  one. (Reported by Chung-chieh Shan)
- Fixed crashes with null bytes in PCRS replacement strings
  (Patch provided by Felix Gröbert).
- Fixed crashes with header time randomization on mingw32.
- The CGI style sheet is no longer delivered if the referring
  page isn't a Privoxy CGI page. This prevents a JavaScript-based
  Privoxy detection "attack". Note that detecting Privoxy is
  still possible through other ways and Privoxy was never intended
  to be invisible anyway.
- Added support for AmigaOS 4, fixed build for AmigaOS 3.x.	
- The show-url-info CGI page displays a warning if Privoxy
  is currently toggled off.
- The show-status CGI page suppresses the edit button
  for action files if Privoxy has no write access.	
- Most CGI error pages react properly to HEAD requests.
- Requests with RFC 3253 HTTP methods (used by Subversion)
  are accepted. (Patch provided by Petr Kadlec)
- New config option "templdir" to change the location
  of the CGI templates to make sure customized templates
  aren't "updated".
- Better handling of "HTTP/1.1 100 Continue" responses.
- The background of the PNG pattern is transparent.
- Fixed XML syntax errors caused by banners-by-size and banners-by-url.
- Fixed crashes and possible action file corruptions
  when lines containing hashes are written through the CGI editor.
- Supports dynamic filters which can contain variables.
- Supports tags to change the actions based on client or server headers.
- Incorrect actions are logged before program termination.
- The "actionsfile" syntax in the configuration file is consistent
  with the rest of the configuration options and requires the
  whole file name. This is an incompatible change, if you use
  an old configuration file you might have to append ".action"
  to your "actionsfile" directives.
- With the configuration file option "enforce-blocks" the
  "go there anyway" mechanism can be disabled without recompiling
  Privoxy.
- More precise error messages in case of incorrect acl syntax.
- Logs a warning if filtering is enabled but impossible due
  to lack of zlib support or use of the prevent-compression action.
- Less noisy handling of Cookie:" and "Connection:" headers.
- Improved error messages in case of connection problems.
- Fix a command-line-parsing bug that was introduced before 3.0.5
  beta and caused Privoxy to treat the last argument as configuration
  file if no configuration file was specified.
- Treat unknown command line options as fatal errors instead
  of silently ignoring them.
- Use string functions with length checks more often.
- Don't log CONNECT requests twice.
- Allow to log the source address for ACL-related connection drops.
- Don't ignore applying filters if the server didn't
  specify a Content-Type. Bug reported by Amuro Namie.
- Rejected CONNECT requests are logged with log level info
  (enabled by default) and the reason for the block.
- New command line option "--pre-chroot-nslookup hostname" to
  intialize the resolver library before chroot'ing. On some systems this
  reduces the number of files that must be copied into the chroot tree.
  (Patch provided by Stephen Gildea)
- Fix a long-standing memory corruption bug that could cause
  Privoxy to overwrite a single byte in memory it didn't explicitly
  allocate (but that probably was allocated anyway due to bucket size).
- Send template-based CGI pages as HTTP/1.1 unless the client
  asked for HTTP/1.0.
- Let the first line in connection established responses
  end in \r\n as required by RFC1945. Reported by Bert van Leeuwen.
- If no log file has been specified, disable logging instead of logging
  to stderr.
- Don't block stderr when in daemon mode.
- Ignore missing zero-chunks when filtering chunk-encoded content.
  Earlier Privoxy versions would buffer and then forward the content
  unmodified which caused some browsers to simply show empty pages.
- Fix double free in cgi_edit_actions_list(). Reported by Venustech AD-LAB.
- The code to add X-Forwarded-For headers has been removed.
- Fixed trustfile feature which previously didn't work without FEATURE_TOGGLE.
  Reported by Lee.
- Minor code clean-ups, filter and action file updates.
  (Some of them reported by Davide Alberani, Markus Elfring,
   Stefan Huehner and Adam Piggott)

*** Version 3.0.6 ***

- New content filters: no-ping, google, msn, yahoo and blogspot.
- New header filters:  x-httpd-php-to-html, html-to-xml, xml-to-html
                       and hide-tor-exit-notation.
- The special header "X-Filter: No" now disables header filtering as well.
- Improved the filters img-reorder, js-annoyances, webbugs,
  banners-by-size, banners-by-link and ie-exploits to make them
  less likely to break anything.
- Removed outdated URL patterns in default.action and added new ones. 
- Added redirection from http://p.p/user-manual to http://p.p/user-manual/
- Changed webinterface default values for hide-user-agent, hide-referrer
  and set-image-blocker.
	
*** Version 3.0.5 ***

- Windows version can be installed/started as a service.
- Windows icon stays blue when Privoxy is idle, green when busy.
- Integrated Fabian Keil's extensive patch.  See:
  http://www.fabiankeil.de/sourcecode/privoxy/. Includes the 
  following new or significantly improved actions (among many 
  other improvements):

     content-type-overwrite{}
     crunch-client-header{string}
     crunch-if-none-match
     crunch-server-header{string}
     fast-redirects{check-decoded-url}
     filter-client-headers
     filter-server-headers
     force-text-mode
     handle-as-empty-document
     hide-accept-language{}
     hide-content-disposition{}
     hide-if-modified-since
     hide-referrer{conditional-block}
     overwrite-last-modified{}
     redirect{URL}
     treat-forbidden-connects-like-blocks

- Standard-compliant clients are prevented from displaying cached
  copies of Privoxy's error messages after the cause of the problem
  has gone.

- Multiple filter files can now be specified in config.
- Added jpeg filtering to defend against MS jpeg vulnerability MS04-028
  with the new inspect-jpegs action.
- Removed the "arbitrary" 1000 filter limit - addresses tracker #911950
- Thanks to Jindrich Makovicka for a race condition fix for the log 
  file.  The race condition remains for non-pthread implementations.
  Reference patch #1175720. Various other logging enhancements.

  (for trustfile users).

*** Version 3.0.3 ***

- Fixed yet another two memory leaks. Process growth seems stopped now.
- Further tightened security against malicious toggle-off links.
- Excluded text/plain MIME types from filtering. This fixes a
  couple of client-crashing, download corruption and
  Privoxy performance issues, whose root cause lies in
  web servers labelling content of unknown type as text/plain.
- Assorted fixes for POSIX compliance, signal handling, graceful
  termination, compiler warnings, OSX support, Win32 systray,
  error logging, hostname wildcards, correct detection of NetBSD.
- Workarounds for client (iTunes etc) and server (PHP < 4.2.3) bugs
  including the notorious "blank page" problem.

  filter became less destructive     
- Major revamp of the actions file
	
*** Version 3.0.2 ***

- Fixed two memory leaks, one serious

    img-reorder, banners-by-size, banners-by-link, webbugs, refresh-tags,
    html-annoyances, content-cookies and fun filters
  - Replaced filter "popups" by choice between two modes:
    - "unsolicited-popups" tries to catch only the unsolicited ones
    - "all-popups" tries to kill them all (as before)
  - New filter "tiny-textforms" Help those tiny or hard-wrap textareas. 
  - New filter "jumping-windows" that prevents windows from resizing
    and moving themselves
  - New filter "demoronizer" which fixes MS's abuse of std charsets
    (common cases anyway).
  - Replaced "nimda" with more general "ie-exploits" filter in which
    all filters for exploits shall be collected
- Improved cookie logging
- Rewrote make install target. Added uninstall and install-strip
  targets.
- Fixed a potential (application-level, NOT OS-level!) security
  problem involving remote toggling and action file manipulation
  by mailicious websites.
- Added ability to chroot (thanks to Sviatoslav Sviridov)

- Address spurious 'out of memory' error due to incorrect file permissions.
- Impose buffer limits while reading client and server headers.
- Better memory and CPU optimization.
- Add Conectiva Linux package.
- user-manual directive added to config for help links from within CGI
  editor.
- Multiple actions files can now be specified in config.

  reflected throughout (file locations, etc).
- ijb.action is now default.action. re_filterfile is now 
  default.filter.
- http://i.j.b/ is now http://p.p/
- The 'logo' option for replacing ad iamges is removed now. 'Pattern' 
  (checkerboard) is now the default.
- RPM spec file make over.


*** Version 2.9.12 Beta *** 

- **READ**: The default listening PORT is NOW 8118!!! Changed from 
  8000 due to conflict with NAS (Network Audio Server, whatever that 
  is.)
- More CGI actions editor fixes and improvements.
- Win32 command line fix ups.
- re_filterfile now has modular sections that can be activated on a 
  per site basis. Some new goodies there too.
- +filter now takes arguments to match FILTER sections in re_filterfile
  for even more flexibility. 
- Added a new image blocker option: +image-blocker{pattern}, which 
  displays a checkerboard patthern and scales better than the logo.
- PNG images will be used in place of GIF for JB built-in images
  if configured with --enable-no-gif.
- Clean up compiler warnings (mostly).
- Improved handling of failed DNS lookups & diagnostics for failed bind
  to listen socket

- Better signal handling on *nix.
- Fix CFLAGS hard-coded in configure.in
- Fix threading bug re: gethostbyname() that caused random 
URLs to fail in some cases.


*** Version 2.9.11 Alpha Changes ***

- A web-based editor for the actions file is included (go to http://i.j.b/).
- Web-based toggle IJB on/off support.
- Cookie handling has changed - the new +no-cookies-keep feature is now the
default.
- actionsfile is renamed to ijb.action.
- junkbstr.txt is now config.txt on Win32.
- Support for running IJB as a UNIX daemon process has improved.

- make should now abort if gmake (GNU make) not present.
- Many other minor bugfixes
- Start a ChangeLog :)



*** Version 2.9.3 pre-Alpha Changes ***

- Amiga support (completely untested by me - I don't have an Amiga)
- "tinygif 3" support (redirects blocked images to a specified URL, so
the browser doesn't have to load and cache many copies of the same
image).
- one case where there were both local and global "referrer" variables
(yuck!) clarified by renaming the local one to "refer".
- Fixed some places where close() was used instead of close_socket().
Thanks to Jörg Strohmayer (joergs at users.sourceforge.net) for these.
- Temporary hack to get FORCE_LOAD to work with IE.  I just lowercased the
FORCE_LOAD_PREFIX.  Needs fixing properly.
- Most URLs hardcoded into Junkbuster were changed to go through a script
e.g. http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net/redirect.php?v=2.9.3&to=faq
The only other URLs left are the GNU GPL:
  http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl.html
and the home page:
  http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net/
... and various URLs which will be intercepted by Junkbuster anyway.
TODO: Still need to do something with the URLs in Junkbuster Corp's 
copyright/trademark notice on the bottom of the show-proxy-args page.
- PCRE or GNU Regex is now a #define option.


*** Version 2.9.2 pre-Alpha Changes ***

- Andreas applied the latest version of the FORCE patch.


*** Version 2.9.1 pre-Alpha Changes ***

- in parsers.c, fixed two #ifdef FORCE to #ifdef FORCE_LOAD
(BTW: I think FORCE is precise enough, since loading remote
data is the whole purpose of a proxy..)
- Set the FORCE_PREFIX (back) to 'IJB-FORCE-LOAD-'. While 'noijb.'
is more elegant and looks like a hostname in the URL, it doesn't
make clear to the inexperienced user that the proxy is bypassed. It
also has a higher name collision risk.
- Filled in the function header templates for my functions in
parsers.c (again). They obviously got lost in our current
patch war ;-)
- Cut the credit for the §-referrer-option from the config file,
that Stefan had placed there.
- Improved the re_filterfile 


*** Version 2.9.0 pre-Alpha Changes ***

-  Now use PCRE, not GNU REGEX.  I have not yet had chance to check the
syntax of the block/image/cookie file to ensure that they match what
is expected - however they seem to work.
-  Replaced "configure" script with one generated by "autoconf".  Also 
use a header "config.h" (was ijbconfig.h in my previous release) for 
the #defines.  "config.h" is now generated with "autoheader" from 
"acconfig.h" and "configure.in".  (Note that to install you do not
need autoconf or autoheader - just run "./configure".)
To see command-line options, run "./configure --help".
This is my first ever autoconf script, so it has some rough edges
(how PCRE is handled is the roughest).
-  Error logging code replaced with new module errlog.c, based on the
one from JunkbusterMT (but with the threading code removed).
-  Most of Rodney's 0.21 and 0.21A patches applied. (Marked *).  I did not
apply all of these, since I had already independently done conditional
popup file, conditional image file, and integration of popup code.
- ACL, Jar and trust files conditionally compiled.
- New source file headers.
- Various cosmetic changes.  (But I have not consistently ordered the 
config files - I think that's worthwhile, but it's 1am and I want to
get this released!)
- RCS tags on .h files.
-  RCS tags are const char[] rather than const char *.  (Saves 4 bytes
per tag ;-)
- VC++ project files renamed to vc_junkbuster.*.
- show-proxy-args now shows status of all conditionals, not just REGEX
- Various functions moved around.  Most notably all the system-specific
sockets code which was spread between jcc.c, bind.c, and connect.c,
has been moved to "jbsockets.c".  The non-system-specific code from
connect.c and socks4.c has been movet to "gateway.c".  Also, the
config file loader and the global variables it writes to have been
moved to "loadcfg.c".  (Maybe this should go into loaders.c?)
And candidate for the "worst filename ever" award is "miscutil.c",
which contains, well, miscellaneous utility functions like zalloc.
(Suggestions for a better name for this file are welcome!)
- Loaders now use a common function to read a line and skip comments,
and this function also stores the proxy_args.
- Added ./junkbuster --help     (Not for Win32 GUI)
- Added ./junkbuster --version  (Not for Win32 GUI)
- Win32 resources are now all marked as "U.S. English", rather than
being a mix of "U.S. English", "U.K. English" and "Irish English".
- Version number changes to 2.9.0
