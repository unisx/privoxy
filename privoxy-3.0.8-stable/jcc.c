 *
 *    Revision 1.159  2007/11/24 14:34:09  fabiankeil
 *    In the HTTP snipplets, refer to the client as client.
 *
 *    Revision 1.158  2007/11/11 16:44:17  fabiankeil

 *    once for mingw32 and provide some more details.
 *
 *    Revision 1.156  2007/11/01 18:20:58  fabiankeil
 *    Initialize log module after initializing mutexes, future
 *    deadlocks in that code should now work cross-platform.
 *
 *    Revision 1.155  2007/10/23 20:12:45  fabiankeil
 *    Fix first CSUCCEED line to end in \r\n as required by RFC1945.

 *
 *    Revision 1.152  2007/10/04 18:03:34  fabiankeil
 *    - Fix a crash when parsing invalid requests whose first header
 *      is rejected by get_header(). Regression (re?)introduced
 *      in r1.143 by yours truly.
 *    - Move ACTION_VANILLA_WAFER handling into parsers.c's
 *      client_cookie_adder() to make sure send-vanilla-wafer can be
 *      controlled through tags (and thus regression-tested).
 *
 *    Revision 1.151  2007/09/29 10:21:16  fabiankeil
 *    - Move get_filter_function() from jcc.c to filters.c
 *      so the filter functions can be static.
 *    - Don't bother filtering body-less responses.
 *
 *    Revision 1.150  2007/09/28 16:39:29  fabiankeil
 *    Execute content filters through execute_content_filter().
 *
 *    Revision 1.149  2007/09/04 15:08:48  fabiankeil
 *    Initialize req to NULL to make sure it's defined if the
 *    first read_socket() call fails. Reported by icmp30.
 *

 *    Add Stephen Gildea's --pre-chroot-nslookup patch [#1276666],
 *    extensive comments moved to user manual.
 *
 *    Revision 1.147  2007/08/25 14:42:40  fabiankeil
 *    Don't crash if a broken header filter wiped out the request line.
 *
 *    Revision 1.146  2007/08/20 17:09:32  fabiankeil
 *    Fix byte_count calculation in case of flushes
 *    and don't parse the server headers a second time.
 *
 *    Revision 1.145  2007/08/19 13:13:31  fabiankeil
 *    - If there's a connection problem after we already forwarded
 *      parts of the original content, just hang up. Fixes BR#1776724.
 *    - Fix warnings about unused code on mingw32.
 *    - In case of flushes, calculate the byte count
 *      less incorrectly (I think).
 *
 *    Revision 1.144  2007/08/11 14:43:22  fabiankeil
 *    Add some more prototypes for static functions.
 *
 *    Revision 1.143  2007/08/05 13:58:19  fabiankeil
 *    Comment out request_contains_null_bytes() until it's used again.
 *
 *    Revision 1.142  2007/08/05 13:50:26  fabiankeil
 *    #1763173 from Stefan Huehner: s@const static@static const@
 *    and declare some more functions static.
 *
 *    Revision 1.141  2007/08/04 09:56:23  fabiankeil
 *    - Log rejected CONNECT requests with LOG_LEVEL_INFO
 *      and explain why they were rejected in the first place.
 *    - Fix the LOG_LEVEL_CLF message for crunches of unallowed
 *      CONNECT requests. The request line was missing.
 *    - Add two more XXX reminders as we don't have enough already.
 *
 *    Revision 1.140  2007/07/21 11:51:36  fabiankeil
 *    As Hal noticed, checking dispatch_cgi() as the last cruncher
 *    looks like a bug if CGI requests are blocked unintentionally,
 *    so don't do it unless the user enabled the new config option
 *    "allow-cgi-request-crunching".
 *
 *    Revision 1.139  2007/07/14 07:46:41  fabiankeil
 *    - Allow to rewrite the request destination behind the client's back.
 *    - Turn the weird-looking unconditional for loop that
 *      reads the client request into a conditional while loop.
 *      Move the stuff that only runs once out of the loop.
 *    - Move parts of chat(), server_content_type() and the
 *      necessary stuff to fix BR#1750917 into get_filter_function().
 *
 *    Revision 1.138  2007/06/03 18:45:18  fabiankeil
 *    Temporary workaround for BR#1730105.
 *
 *    Revision 1.137  2007/06/01 18:16:36  fabiankeil
 *    Use the same mutex for gethostbyname() and gethostbyaddr() to prevent
 *    deadlocks and crashes on OpenBSD and possibly other OS with neither
 *    gethostbyname_r() nor gethostaddr_r(). Closes BR#1729174.
 *    Thanks to Ralf Horstmann for report and solution.
 *
 *    Revision 1.136  2007/06/01 16:41:11  fabiankeil
 *    Add forward-override{} to change the forwarding settings through
 *    action sections. This is mainly interesting to forward different
 *    clients differently (for example based on User-Agent or request
 *    origin).
 *
 *    Revision 1.135  2007/05/24 17:03:50  fabiankeil
 *    - Let usage() mention the --chroot parameter.
 *    - Use read_socket() consistently and always leave
 *      the last buffer byte alone, even in cases where
 *      null termination (currently) doesn't matter.
 *
 *    Revision 1.134  2007/05/16 14:59:46  fabiankeil
 *    - Fix config file loading on Unix if no config file is specified.
 *      Since r1.97 Privoxy would always interpret the last argument as
 *      config file, even if it's a valid command line option.
 *    - Abort in case of unrecognized command line options. Closes #1719696.
 *    - Remove a bunch of unnecessary strcpy() calls (yay for c&p without thinking).
 *    - Replace the remaining strcpy() and strcat() calls with strlcpy() and strcat().
 *
 *    Revision 1.133  2007/05/04 11:23:19  fabiankeil
 *    - Don't rerun crunchers that only depend on the request URL.
 *    - Don't count redirects and CGI requests as "blocked requests".
 *
 *    Revision 1.132  2007/04/25 15:15:17  fabiankeil
 *    Support crunching based on tags created by server-header taggers.
 *
 *    Revision 1.131  2007/04/22 13:24:50  fabiankeil
 *    Make HTTP snippets static (again). Add a Content-Type for those
 *    with content so the browser doesn't guess it based on the URL.
 *
 *    Revision 1.130  2007/04/19 13:47:34  fabiankeil
 *    Move crunching and request line rebuilding out of chat().
 *
 *    Revision 1.129  2007/04/15 16:39:20  fabiankeil
 *    Introduce tags as alternative way to specify which
 *    actions apply to a request. At the moment tags can be
 *    created based on client and server headers.
 *
 *    Revision 1.128  2007/03/25 16:55:54  fabiankeil
 *    Don't CLF-log CONNECT requests twice.
 *
 *    Revision 1.127  2007/03/20 13:53:17  fabiankeil
 *    Log the source address for ACL-related connection drops.
 *
 *    Revision 1.126  2007/03/17 15:20:05  fabiankeil
 *    New config option: enforce-blocks.
 *
 *    Revision 1.125  2007/03/09 14:12:00  fabiankeil
 *    - Move null byte check into separate function.
 *    - Don't confuse the client with error pages
 *      if a CONNECT request was already confirmed.
 *
 *    Revision 1.124  2007/02/23 14:59:54  fabiankeil
 *    Speed up NULL byte escaping and only log the complete
 *    NULL byte requests with header debugging enabled.
 *
 *    Revision 1.123  2007/02/21 18:42:10  fabiankeil
 *    Answer requests that contain NULL bytes with
 *    a custom response instead of waiting for more
 *    data until the client eventually hangs up.
 *
 *    Revision 1.122  2007/02/07 11:12:02  fabiankeil
 *    - Move delivery and logging of crunched responses
 *      from chat() into send_crunch_response().
 *    - Display the reason for generating http_responses.
 *    - Log the content length for LOG_LEVEL_CLF correctly
 *      (still incorrect for some fixed responses).
 *    - Reword an incorrect comment about
 *      treat-forbidden-connects-like-blocks violating
 *      the specs.
 *    - Add some log messages.
 *
 *    Revision 1.121  2007/01/27 10:52:56  fabiankeil
 *    Move mutex initialization into separate
 *    function and exit in case of errors.
 *
 *    Revision 1.120  2007/01/26 14:18:42  fabiankeil
 *    - Start to reduce chat()'s line count and move
 *      parts of it into separate functions.
 *    - Add "HTTP/1.1 100 Continue" hack for BR 756734.
 *
 *    Revision 1.119  2007/01/25 14:02:30  fabiankeil
 *    - Add Proxy-Agent header to HTTP snippets that are
 *      supposed to reach HTTP clients only.
 *    - Made a few CONNECT log messages more descriptive.
 *    - Catch completely empty server responses (as seen
 *      with Tor's fake ".noconnect" top level domain).
 *    - Use shiny new "forwarding-failed" template for socks errors.
 *
 *    Revision 1.118  2007/01/07 07:43:43  joergs
 *    AmigaOS4 support added.
 *
 *    Revision 1.117  2006/12/31 17:56:37  fabiankeil
 *    Added config option accept-intercepted-requests
 *    and disabled it by default.
 *
 *    Revision 1.116  2006/12/29 19:08:22  fabiankeil
 *    Reverted parts of my last commit
 *    to keep error handling working.
 *
 *    Revision 1.115  2006/12/29 17:38:57  fabiankeil
 *    Fixed gcc43 conversion warnings.
 *
 *    Revision 1.114  2006/12/27 18:52:02  fabiankeil
 *    Fix -pedantic ISO C warning about converting
 *    from function pointer to object pointer.
 *
 *    Revision 1.113  2006/12/26 17:38:50  fabiankeil
 *    Silence compiler warning I introduced with my last commit.
 *
 *    Revision 1.112  2006/12/26 17:31:41  fabiankeil
 *    Mutex protect rand() if POSIX threading
 *    is used, warn the user if that's not possible
 *    and stop using it on _WIN32 where it could
 *    cause crashes.
 *
 *    Revision 1.111  2006/12/23 16:15:06  fabiankeil
 *    Don't prevent core dumps by catching SIGABRT.
 *    It's rude and makes debugging unreasonable painful.
 *
 *    Revision 1.110  2006/12/13 14:52:53  etresoft
 *    Fix build failure on MacOS X. Global symbols can be either static or extern, but not both.
 *
 *    Revision 1.109  2006/12/06 19:41:40  fabiankeil
 *    Privoxy is now able to run as intercepting
 *    proxy in combination with any packet filter
 *    that does the port redirection. The destination
 *    is extracted from the "Host:" header which
 *    should be available for nearly all requests.
 *
 *    Moved HTTP snipplets into jcc.c.
 *    Added error message for gopher proxy requests.
 *
 *    Revision 1.108  2006/11/28 15:38:51  fabiankeil
 *    Only unlink the pidfile if it's actually used.
 *
 *    Change order of interception checks to make
 *    it possible to block or redirect requests for
 *    the cgi pages.
 *
 *    Revision 1.107  2006/11/13 19:05:51  fabiankeil
 *    Make pthread mutex locking more generic. Instead of
 *    checking for OSX and OpenBSD, check for FEATURE_PTHREAD
 *    and use mutex locking unless there is an _r function
 *    available. Better safe than sorry.
 *
 *    Fixes "./configure --disable-pthread" and should result
 *    in less threading-related problems on pthread-using platforms,
 *    but it still doesn't fix BR#1122404.
 *
 *    Revision 1.106  2006/11/06 19:58:23  fabiankeil
 *    Move pthread.h inclusion from jcc.c to jcc.h.
 *    Fixes build on x86-freebsd1 (FreeBSD 5.4-RELEASE).
 *
 *    Revision 1.105  2006/11/06 14:26:02  fabiankeil
 *    Don't exit after receiving the second SIGHUP on Solaris.
 *
 *    Fixes BR 1052235, but the same problem may exist on other
 *    systems. Once 3.0.6 is out we should use sigset()
 *    where available and see if it breaks anything.
 *
 *    Revision 1.104  2006/09/23 13:26:38  roro
 *    Replace TABs by spaces in source code.
 *
 *    Revision 1.103  2006/09/21 12:54:43  fabiankeil
 *    Fix +redirect{}. Didn't work with -fast-redirects.
 *
 *    Revision 1.102  2006/09/06 13:03:04  fabiankeil
 *    Respond with 400 and a short text message
 *    if the client tries to use Privoxy as FTP proxy.
 *
 *    Revision 1.101  2006/09/06 09:23:37  fabiankeil
 *    Make number of retries in case of forwarded-connect problems
 *    a config file option (forwarded-connect-retries) and use 0 as
 *    default.
 *
 *    Revision 1.100  2006/09/03 19:42:59  fabiankeil
 *    Set random(3) seed.
 *
 *    Revision 1.99  2006/09/02 15:36:42  fabiankeil
 *    Follow the OpenBSD port's lead and protect the resolve
 *    functions on OpenBSD as well.
 *
 *    Revision 1.98  2006/08/24 11:01:34  fabiankeil
 *    --user fix. Only use the user as group if no group is specified.
 *    Solves BR 1492612. Thanks to Spinor S. and David Laight.
 *
 *    Revision 1.97  2006/08/18 15:23:17  david__schmidt
 *    Windows service (re-)integration
 *
 *    The new args are:
 *
 *    --install[:service_name]
 *    --uninstall[:service_name]
 *    --service
 *
 *    They work as follows:
 *    --install will create a service for you and then terminate.
 *    By default the service name will be "privoxy" (without the quotes).
 *    However you can run multiple services if you wish, just by adding
 *    a colon and then a name (no spaces).
 *
 *    --uninstall follows the exact same rules a --install.
 *
 *    --service is used when the program is executed by the service
 *    control manager, and in normal circumstances would never be
 *    used as a command line argument.
 *
 *    Revision 1.96  2006/08/15 20:12:36  david__schmidt
 *    Windows service integration
 *
 *    Revision 1.95  2006/08/03 02:46:41  david__schmidt

 *
 *    Revision 1.92.2.15  2004/10/03 12:53:32  david__schmidt
 *    Add the ability to check jpeg images for invalid
 *    lengths of comment blocks.  Defensive strategy
 *    against the exploit:
 *       Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-028
 *       Buffer Overrun in JPEG Processing (GDI+) Could
 *       Allow Code Execution (833987)
 *    Enabled with +inspect-jpegs in actions files.

 *    Revision 1.92.2.5  2003/03/10 23:45:32  oes
 *    Fixed bug #700381: Non-Threaded version now capable of being toggled.
 *    Children now report having been toggled through _exit(17), parents
 *    watch for that code and toggle themselves if found.
 *
 *    Revision 1.92.2.4  2003/03/07 03:41:04  david__schmidt
 *    Wrapping all *_r functions (the non-_r versions of them) with 
 *    mutex semaphores for OSX.  Hopefully this will take care of all 
 *    of those pesky crash reports.
 *
 *    Revision 1.92.2.3  2003/02/28 12:53:06  oes
 *    Fixed two mostly harmless mem leaks
 *
 *    Revision 1.92.2.2  2002/11/20 14:37:47  oes
 *    Fix: Head of global clients list now initialized to NULL
 *
 *    Revision 1.92.2.1  2002/09/25 14:52:24  oes
 *    Added basic support for OPTIONS and TRACE HTTP methods:
 *     - New interceptor direct_response() added in chat().
 *     - sed() moved to earlier in the process, so that the
 *       Host: header is evaluated before actions and forwarding
 *       are decided on.
 *
 *    Revision 1.92  2002/05/08 16:00:46  oes
 *    Chat's buffer handling:
 *     - Fixed bug with unchecked out-of-mem conditions
 *       while reading client request & server headers
 *     - No longer predict if the buffer limit will be exceeded
 *       in the next read -- check add_to_iob's new
 *       return code. If buffer couldn't be extended
 *       (policy or out-of-mem) while
 *       - reading from client: abort
 *       - reading server headers: send error page
 *       - buffering server body for filter: flush,
 *         and if that fails: send error page
 *

 *    Revision 1.83  2002/03/16 23:54:06  jongfoster
 *    Adding graceful termination feature, to help look for memory leaks.
 *    If you enable this (which, by design, has to be done by hand
 *    editing config.h) and then go to http://i.j.b/die, then the program
 *    will exit cleanly after the *next* request.  It should free all the
 *    memory that was used.

 *    Killing warnings

 *
 *    Revision 1.80  2002/03/11 22:07:05  david__schmidt
 *    OS/2 port maintenance:
 *    - Fixed EMX build - it had decayed a little
 *    - Fixed inexplicable crash during FD_ZERO - must be due to a bad macro.
 *      substituted a memset for now.
 *
 *    Revision 1.79  2002/03/09 20:03:52  jongfoster
 *    - Making various functions return int rather than size_t.
 *      (Undoing a recent change).  Since size_t is unsigned on
 *      Windows, functions like read_socket that return -1 on
 *      error cannot return a size_t.
 *
 *      THIS WAS A MAJOR BUG - it caused frequent, unpredictable
 *      crashes, and also frequently caused JB to jump to 100%
 *      CPU and stay there.  (Because it thought it had just
 *      read ((unsigned)-1) == 4Gb of data...)
 *
 *    - The signature of write_socket has changed, it now simply
 *      returns success=0/failure=nonzero.
 *
 *    - Trying to get rid of a few warnings --with-debug on
 *      Windows, I've introduced a new type "jb_socket".  This is
 *      used for the socket file descriptors.  On Windows, this
 *      is SOCKET (a typedef for unsigned).  Everywhere else, it's
 *      an int.  The error value can't be -1 any more, so it's
 *      now JB_INVALID_SOCKET (which is -1 on UNIX, and in
 *      Windows it maps to the #define INVALID_SOCKET.)
 *
 *    - The signature of bind_port has changed.
 *
 *    Revision 1.78  2002/03/08 21:35:04  oes
 *    Added optional group supplement to --user option. Will now use default group of user if no group given

 *    Revision 1.50  2001/10/25 03:40:48  david__schmidt
 *    Change in porting tactics: OS/2's EMX porting layer doesn't allow multiple
 *    threads to call select() simultaneously.  So, it's time to do a real, live,
 *    native OS/2 port.  See defines for __EMX__ (the porting layer) vs. __OS2__
 *    (native). Both versions will work, but using __OS2__ offers multi-threading.
 *
 *    Revision 1.49  2001/10/23 21:41:35  jongfoster
 *    Added call to initialize the (statically-allocated of course)
 *    "out of memory" CGI response.
 *
 *    Revision 1.48  2001/10/10 19:56:46  jongfoster

 *    Revision 1.45  2001/10/07 15:42:11  oes
 *    Replaced 6 boolean members of csp with one bitmap (csp->flags)
 *
 *    Moved downgrading of the HTTP version from parse_http_request to
 *      chat(), since we can't decide if it is necessary before we have
 *      determined the actions for the URL. The HTTP command is now
 *      *always* re-built so the repairs need no longer be special-cased.
 *
 *    filter_popups now gets a csp pointer so it can raise the new
 *      CSP_FLAG_MODIFIED flag.
 *
 *    Bugfix
 *
 *    Added configurable size limit for the IOB. If the IOB grows so
 *      large that the next read would exceed the limit, the header
 *      is generated, and the header & unfiltered buffer are flushed
 *      to the client. Chat then continues in non-buffering,
 *      non-filtering body mode.

 *
 *    Revision 1.27  2001/07/19 19:09:47  haroon
 *    - Added code to take care of the situation where while processing the first
 *      server response (which includes the server header), after finding the end
 *      of the headers we were not looking past the end of the headers for
 *      content modification. I enabled it for filter_popups.
 *      Someone else should look to see if other similar operations should be
 *      done to the discarded portion of the buffer.
 *
 *      Note 2001/07/20: No, the other content modification mechanisms will process
 *                       the whole iob later anyway. --oes

 *    Revision 1.24  2001/07/13 14:00:40  oes
 *     - Generic content modification scheme:
 *       Each feature has its own applicability flag that is set
 *       from csp->action->flags.
 *       Replaced the "filtering" int flag , by a function pointer
 *       "content_filter" to the function that will do the content
 *       modification. If it is != NULL, the document will be buffered
 *       and processed through *content_filter, which must set
 *       csp->content_length and return a modified copy of the body
 *       or return NULL (on failiure).
 *     - Changed csp->is_text to the more generic bitmap csp->content_type
 *       which can currently take the valued CT_TEXT or CT_GIF
 *     - Reformatting etc
 *     - Removed all #ifdef PCRS
 *
 *    Revision 1.23  2001/07/02 02:28:25  iwanttokeepanon
 *    Added "#ifdef ACL_FILES" conditional compilation to line 1291 to exclude

 *      place, with one (CGI) answer generation
 *      mechansim. Much clearer now.
 *    - Removed the GIF image generation, which
 *      is now done in filters.c:block_url()
 *    - Made error conditions like domain lookup
 *      failiure or (various) problems while talking
 *      to the server use cgi.c:error_response()
 *      instead of generating HTML/HTTP in chat() (yuck!)
 *    - Removed logentry from cancelled commit

 *
 *    Revision 1.16  2001/06/01 18:49:17  jongfoster
 *    Replaced "list_share" with "list" - the tiny memory gain was not
 *    worth the extra complexity.
 *
 *    Revision 1.15  2001/05/31 21:24:47  jongfoster
 *    Changed "permission" to "action" throughout.
 *    Removed DEFAULT_USER_AGENT - it must now be specified manually.
 *    Moved vanilla wafer check into chat(), since we must now
 *    decide whether or not to add it based on the URL.
 *
 *    Revision 1.14  2001/05/29 20:14:01  joergs
 *    AmigaOS bugfix: PCRS needs a lot of stack, stacksize for child threads
 *    increased.
 *
 *    Revision 1.13  2001/05/29 09:50:24  jongfoster
 *    Unified blocklist/imagelist/permissionslist.
 *    File format is still under discussion, but the internal changes
 *    are (mostly) done.
 *
 *    Also modified interceptor behaviour:
 *    - We now intercept all URLs beginning with one of the following
 *      prefixes (and *only* these prefixes):
 *        * http://i.j.b/
 *        * http://ijbswa.sf.net/config/
 *        * http://ijbswa.sourceforge.net/config/
 *    - New interceptors "home page" - go to http://i.j.b/ to see it.
 *    - Internal changes so that intercepted and fast redirect pages
 *      are not replaced with an image.
 *    - Interceptors now have the option to send a binary page direct
 *      to the client. (i.e. ijb-send-banner uses this)
 *    - Implemented show-url-info interceptor.  (Which is why I needed
 *      the above interceptors changes - a typical URL is
 *      "http://i.j.b/show-url-info?url=www.somesite.com/banner.gif".
 *      The previous mechanism would not have intercepted that, and
 *      if it had been intercepted then it then it would have replaced
 *      it with an image.)
 *
 *    Revision 1.12  2001/05/27 22:17:04  oes
 *
 *    - re_process_buffer no longer writes the modified buffer
 *      to the client, which was very ugly. It now returns the
 *      buffer, which it is then written by chat.
 *
 *    - content_length now adjusts the Content-Length: header
 *      for modified documents rather than crunch()ing it.
 *      (Length info in csp->content_length, which is 0 for
 *      unmodified documents)
 *
 *    - For this to work, sed() is called twice when filtering.
 *
 *    Revision 1.11  2001/05/26 17:27:53  jongfoster
 *    Added support for CLF and fixed LOG_LEVEL_LOG.

 *
 *    Revision 1.10  2001/05/26 15:26:15  jongfoster
 *    ACL feature now provides more security by immediately dropping

 *    Revision 1.9  2001/05/26 00:28:36  jongfoster
 *    Automatic reloading of config file.
 *    Removed obsolete SIGHUP support (Unix) and Reload menu option (Win32).
 *    Most of the global variables have been moved to a new
 *    struct configuration_spec, accessed through csp->config->globalname
 *    Most of the globals remaining are used by the Win32 GUI.

 *      by adding patterns that replace all standard banner
 *      sizes with the "Junkbuster" gif to the re_filterfile
 *
 *    - Enabled filtering WebBugs by providing a pattern
 *      which kills all 1x1 images
 *
 *    - Added support for PCRE_UNGREEDY behaviour to pcrs,
 *      which is selected by the (nonstandard and therefore
 *      capital) letter 'U' in the option string.
 *      It causes the quantifiers to be ungreedy by default.
 *      Appending a ? turns back to greedy (!).
 *
 *    - Added a new interceptor ijb-send-banner, which
 *      sends back the "Junkbuster" gif. Without imagelist or
 *      MSIE detection support, or if tinygif = 1, or the
 *      URL isn't recognized as an imageurl, a lame HTML
 *      explanation is sent instead.
 *
 *    - Added new feature, which permits blocking remote
 *      script redirects and firing back a local redirect
 *      to the browser.
 *      The feature is conditionally compiled, i.e. it
 *      can be disabled with --disable-fast-redirects,
 *      plus it must be activated by a "fast-redirects"
 *      line in the config file, has its own log level
 *      and of course wants to be displayed by show-proxy-args
 *      Note: Boy, all the #ifdefs in 1001 locations and
 *      all the fumbling with configure.in and acconfig.h
 *      were *way* more work than the feature itself :-(
 *
 *    - Because a generic redirect template was needed for
 *      this, tinygif = 3 now uses the same.
 *
 *    - Moved GIFs, and other static HTTP response templates
 *      to project.h
 *
 *    - Some minor fixes
 *
 *    - Removed some >400 CRs again (Jon, you really worked
 *      a lot! ;-)
 *
 *    Revision 1.4  2001/05/21 19:34:01  jongfoster
 *    Made failure to bind() a fatal error.
 *
 *    Revision 1.3  2001/05/20 01:21:20  jongfoster
 *    Version 2.9.4 checkin.
 *    - Merged popupfile and cookiefile, and added control over PCRS
 *      filtering, in new "permissionsfile".
 *    - Implemented LOG_LEVEL_FATAL, so that if there is a configuration
 *      file error you now get a message box (in the Win32 GUI) rather
 *      than the program exiting with no explanation.
 *    - Made killpopup use the PCRS MIME-type checking and HTTP-header
 *      skipping.
 *    - Removed tabs from "config"
 *    - Moved duplicated url parsing code in "loaders.c" to a new funcition.
 *    - Bumped up version number.
 *
 *    Revision 1.2  2001/05/17 22:34:44  oes
 *     - Added hint on GIF char array generation to jcc.c
 *     - Cleaned CRLF's from the sources and related files
 *     - Repaired logging for REF and FRC
 *
 *    Revision 1.1.1.1  2001/05/15 13:58:56  oes
 *    Initial import of version 2.9.3 source tree
