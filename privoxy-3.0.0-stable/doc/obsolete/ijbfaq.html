    <h2><a name="top"></a>The Top Ten Questions</h2>

    <h3><a name="what"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt="*"
    width="14" height="14">&nbsp; What is the Internet Junkbuster
    Proxy and what does it do for me?</h3>

    <p>The Internet Junkbuster Proxy <small><sup>TM</sup></small>
    is free privacy-enhancing software that can be run on your PC
    or by your ISP or company. It blocks requests for URLs
    (typically banner ads) that match its blockfile. It also
    deletes unauthorized cookies and other unwanted identifying
    header information that is exchanged between web servers and
    browsers. These headers are not normally accessible to users
    (even though they may contain information that's important to
    your privacy), but with the Internet Junkbuster you can see
    almost <a href="ijbman.html#o_d">anything you want</a> and
    control everything you're likely to need. Many people publish
    their blockfiles to help others get started.</p>

    <h3><a name="free"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt="*"
    width="14" height="14">&nbsp; Is there a license fee / warranty
    / registration form / expiration?</h3>

    <p>No, none of these. It's completely free of charge.
    Junkbusters offers you the software to copy, use, modify and
    distribute as you wish, forever, at no charge under the GNU
    General Public License.</p>

    <p><a name="warranty"></a>It comes with no warranty of any
    kind.</p>

    <p><a name="register"></a>You don't have to register, in fact
    we don't even provide a way to do so: the practice of
    registering software is usually just an excuse to send you
    solicitations and sell your name and information about your
    behavior. You are welcome to obtain and use our software as
    anonymously you wish. (Your IP address will naturally be
    disclosed when you download it; use anonymizing software if you
    want to conceal this. We never want to be given any information
    that you consider private or confidential.)</p>

    <p><a name="why"></a>We are often asked why we give away a
    product that many would happily pay for. The answer is that we
    are determined to carry out our mission: to free the world from
    junk communications.</p>

    <h3><a name="windows"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt="*"
    width="14" height="14">&nbsp; Does it run on Windows? On a Mac?
    On the AOL browser?</h3>

    <p>For the latest information on availability, see the
    Distribution Information page. We don't think it will ever run
    on Windows 3.1. But you don't need to have it running on your
    computer if you get your ISP or Systems Administrator at work
    to run it.</p>

    <h3><a name="isp"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt="*"
    width="14" height="14">&nbsp; How can I get my ISP to run the
    Internet Junkbuster?</h3>

    <p>Try their sales or support department (depending on whether
    you are already a customer). <a name="unaware"></a>You might
    send them email including the following URL:<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>
    http://www.junkbusters.com/ht/en/ijbfaq.html#isps</code><br>
     <a name="switch"></a>You could mention that many other ISPs
    provide it, and that you regard it as an important part of your
    decision on where to buy Internet service.</p>

    <h3><a name="who"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt="*"
    width="14" height="14">&nbsp; Who chooses the options that
    control what is blocked?</h3>

    <p>Whoever starts the Internet Junkbuster chooses the options
    and the blockfile. If your ISP runs it for you, they have to
    make these decision (though some may give you a choice of
    proxies, and a way to suggest new URLs to block). If you run it
    on your computer, you get to choose.</p>

    <h3><a name="self"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt="*"
    width="14" height="14">&nbsp; How do I download and run the
    program on my computer?</h3>

    <p>It depends on your platform. If you are using Windows 95 or
    NT, see our separate page on installing under Windows. If you
    have a C compiler and are using almost any flavor of UNIX &reg;
    you download it, compile it, start it running, and then
    configure your browser. Several precompiled packages are also
    available through links in our distribution page, which lists
    all available platforms.</p>

    <p><a name="port"></a>If you are using a platform for which we
    have no current availability, you are welcome to port the code.
    If you do this and you would like us to consider publishing
    your ported version, please tell us.</p>

    <h3><a name="show"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt="*"
    width="14" height="14">&nbsp; How can I tell which blockfile
    and options are being used?</h3>

    <p>Just point your browser to
    http://internet.junkbuster.com/cgi-bin/show-proxy-args or to
    any URL ending in <code>show-proxy-args</code> (even if it
    doesn't exist). It needn't exist because the Internet
    Junkbuster intercepts the request, blocks it, and returns in
    its place information about itself. Using the URL above is
    useful for checking that your browser really is going through
    an Internet Junkbuster, because the <code>junkbuster.com</code>
    server returns a warning if the request actually gets to it.
    Some people set the home page of their browser to such a URL to
    be sure that it is configured to use the proxy.</p>

    <p><a name="headers"></a>If you wish to check the header
    information your proxy is actually sending, a visit to
    http://internet.junkbuster.com/cgi-bin/show_http_headers will
    give you the more relevant ones first. You might also like to
    turn the proxy off and compare the difference. (Don't forget to
    turn it back on again.)</p>

    <h3><a name="responding"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt=
    "*" width="14" height="14">&nbsp; My browser started giving me
    ``server not responding'' messages</h3>

    <p>Once your browser is told to use a proxy such as the
    Internet Junkbuster, it thinks of it as its server for
    everything, so this message means it can't talk to the proxy.
    The Internet Junkbuster may not be running, or you may have
    specified its proxy address incorrectly. Check that the details
    you entered are correct. If you have <code>telnet</code> you
    can try connecting to the appropriate port to see if the
    Internet Junkbuster is running. If your ISP is running the
    Internet Junkbuster, you may want to check with them. If you
    are running it yourself under UNIX &reg;, try looking at a
    <code>ps ax</code> to see if it is running. The <a href=
    "ijbman.html#o_h">port</a> specified in its options should be
    the same one as your browser has configured.</p>

    <h3><a name="idea"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt="*"
    width="14" height="14">&nbsp; I've got this great idea for a
    new feature. Who do I tell?</h3>

    <p>We'd be very interested to hear it, but please bear a few
    things in mind.</p>

    <ol type="1">
      <li><a name="considered"></a>Please check this FAQ to see if
      we've already considered the idea, such as automatic
      detection of banner ads and replacing ads with something else
      such as a transparent GIF.</li>

      <li><a name="confidential"></a>Don't tell us anything you
      want to keep confidential or retain some right over.</li>

      <li><a name="wish"></a>We currently have a long wish list of
      things that we may or may not do in the near future,
      including a version for your favorite computer and a plug-in
      version.</li>

      <li><a name="go4it"></a>If you don't want to wait you're
      welcome to improve on our code, publish your version on the
      Web, and tell us where to find it. Projects that are
      especially welcome include a port to the Mac and extensions
      for HTTP 1.1. (Meanwhile, be sure your browser is configured
      not to use HTTP 1.1.)</li>
    </ol>

    <h3><a name="other"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt="*"
    width="14" height="14">&nbsp; My question isn't listed here.
    Who do I ask for support?</h3>

    <p><a name="harder"></a>If you find using our free product
    harder than you're used to for consumer software, there are
    many commercial alternatives that you could consider.</p>

    <p><a name="RTM"></a>The answer to detailed technical questions
    may be answered in <a href="ijbman.html">manual page</a>, or in
    the source code. Also double-check this page for an answer:
    using the ``find'' feature on your browser for likely keywords
    may help. Our site also has a search feature.</p>

    <p><a name="Use"></a>Many people post requests for help and
    responses on Usenet.</p>

    <p><a name="them"></a>If your ISP is providing the Internet
    Junkbuster for you, and your question is about how to use it,
    check their web page before asking them.</p>

    <p><a name="us"></a>Even though we don't offer the kind of
    support you might expect if you paid a lot of money for a
    software product, you can still ask us. But before you do,
    please consider whether you could ask someone closer to you.
    And please be patient if we're slow to reply: we never charge
    consumers for our services, so we have to subsidize consumers
    with revenue from companies, and our resources are limited.</p>

    <p><a name="quote"></a>If your company or organization would be
    interested in a maintenance contract with phone and email
    support, hard copy documentation and source code and
    pre-compiled binaries on tape or disk, please ask us for a
    quote.</p>

    <h2><a name="browser"></a>Configuring your browser to talk to
    the Internet Junkbuster</h2>

    <h3><a name="address"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt="*"
    width="14" height="14">&nbsp; What is the proxy address of the
    Internet Junkbuster?</h3>

    <p><a name="localhost"></a>If you set up the Internet
    Junkbuster to run on the computer you browse from (rather than
    your ISP's server or some networked computer at work), the
    proxy will be on <code>localhost</code> (which is the special
    name used by every computer on the Internet to refer to itself)
    and the port will be <code>8000</code> (unless you have told
    the Internet Junkbuster to run on a different port with the <a
    href="ijbman.html#listen-address">listen-address</a> option).
    So you when configuring your browser's proxy settings you
    typically enter the word <code>localhost</code> in the two
    boxes next to <b class="eg">HTTP</b> and <b class="eg">
    Secure</b>, and the number <code>8000</code> in the two boxes
    labeled to the right of those boxes. <a name="Gopher"></a>The
    Internet Junkbuster does not currently handle other protocols
    such as Gopher, FTP, or WAIS, so leave those setting unchanged.
    Nor does it handle ICQ or Instant Messenger services.</p>

    <p><a name="remote"></a>If your ISP or company is running the
    Internet Junkbuster for you, they will tell you the address to
    use. It will be the name of the computer it's running on (or
    possibly its numeric IP address), plus a port number. Port 8000
    is the default, so assume this number if it is not specified.
    Sometimes a colon is used to glue them together, as in <code>
    junkbuster.fictitious-pro-privacy-isp.net:8000</code> but with
    most browsers you do not type the colon, you enter the address
    and port number in separate boxes.</p>

    <h3><a name="set"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt="*"
    width="14" height="14">&nbsp; How do I tell the browser where
    to find the Internet Junkbuster?</h3>

    <p>All current browsers can be told the address of a proxy to
    use. You enter the same information in two fields in your
    browser's proxy configuration screen (see list below): one for
    HTTP, and one for the Secure Protocol (assuming your browser
    supports SSL). If you find some information already entered for
    your proxy, see the next question. Here are the menus you go
    through to get to the proxy configuration settings. (We also
    recommend that you disable Java, which is a separate
    operation.) <strong>Make notes on the changes you make so you
    know how to undo them!</strong> You will need to know what you
    did in case you wish to discontinue using the proxy.</p>

    <h3><a name="already"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt="*"
    width="14" height="14">&nbsp; What should I do if I find
    another proxy is already configured?</h3>

    <p>Some ISPs and companies require all Web traffic to go
    through their proxy. In this case you would find your proxy
    configuration with values already set, possibly under <a name=
    "Automatic"></a>Automatic Proxy Configuration (in the case of
    Netscape and MS-IE 3.0 and above). It's probably a firewall
    proxy between your company and the outside world, <a name=
    "cache"></a>or a caching proxy if you're using an ISP.</p>

    <p><a name="f"></a>What needs to be done in this case is to use
    the <a href="ijbman.html#forwardfile">forwardfile</a> option to
    tell the Internet Junkbuster the address of the other proxy.
    Specify a different (unused) port number with the <a href=
    "ijbman.html#listen-address">listen-address</a> option, and
    configure your browser to use that port. If you haven't done
    this kind of thing before, it's probably best to consult your
    systems administrator or ISP about it; check their web page
    first.</p>

    the Internet Junkbuster?</h3>

    <p>Just go through the same procedure you used to start your
    browser using the Internet Junkbuster, but remove the details
    you put in (or if there was something there before, restore
    it). You may need to use <b class="eg">Save Options</b> to make
    this change permanent. On Netscape 3.0 you can go through <b
    class="eg">Options</b>; <b class="eg">Network Preferences</b>;
    <b class="eg">Proxies</b> and click on <b class="eg">No
    Proxy</b> to turn it off, and later click on <b class="eg">
    Manual Proxy Configuration</b> if you want to start using it
    again. (No need to enter the again details under <b class="eg">
    View</b> as you did the first time; they should remain there
    unchanged.)</p>

    <p><a name="shut"></a>This stops your browser talking to the

    <h3><a name="dial"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt="*"
    width="14" height="14">&nbsp; Automatic dialing isn't working
    any more. How do I fix it?</h3>

    <p>Some browsers (such as MSIE-4) can be configured to dial
    your ISP automatically when you click on a link, but this
    feature (called "automatically connect" or "autoconnect") gets
    disabled if you specify a proxy running on your own computer
    (with address <code>localhost</code> or <code>127.0.0.1</code>)
    because these addresses don't require dialing. The Internet
    Junkbuster knows nothing about dialing, so it doesn't work. To
    make automatic dialing work, make up a name such as <code>
    junkbuster.ijb</code> and use that name in the proxy settings
    instead of <code>localhost</code>, and then add the line <code>
    127.0.0.1 junkbuster.ijb</code> to the file <code>
    c:\windows\hosts</code> (if there already is a line beginning
    with <code>127.0.0.1</code> just add <code>
    junkbuster.ijb</code> at the end of it.)</p>

    <p><a name="also"></a>This should also work Netscape
    Communicator 4 on machines where IE-4 has been installed.</p>

        some convenient place such as <code>
        /usr/local/lib/junkbuster/configfile</code> or whatever you
        choose. The sample file has all the options commented out.
        You can remove the <code>#</code> character on any that you
        want, but it may be better to leave this until to later.
        Run it asynchronously:<br>

    <p>A <code>.exe</code> file (binary) is supplied with the
    source code, but if you prefer to compile it yourself here is
    the likely procedure. Most of these steps are repeated in our
    checklist for installation under Windows.</p>

    <ol type="1">
      <li><a name="zip"></a>First click here to download the zip
      file called <code>ijb20.zip</code> (~208k), then uncompress
      and unpack the zip archive using a tool like WinZip.</li>

      <li><a name="change"></a>Now the distribution (source and
      sample files) will be in a folder called <code>ijb20</code>.
      Go into that folder and then edit the Makefile for your
      system, removing the comment character (<code>#</code>) in
      the lines related to Win32. Then type:<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>nmake</code><br>
       This should create an executable called <code>
      junkbstr.exe</code>. <a name="compilers"></a>For information
      on issues with various compilers, see the Distribution
      Information page.</li>

      <li>
        <a name="attempt"></a>Run the executable with the
        command:<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>junkbstr</code><br>
         <a name="terminal"></a>(Click on the icon with that name
        that looks like a terminal, not like a notepad.) The
        program will produce a message indicating that it has
        started and is ready to serve. 

        <p><a name="ini"></a>(Version 2.0.1 and above uses the file
        <code>junkbstr.ini</code> as the config file if it exists
        and no argument was given. If you have an earlier version
        or if you want it to use a different config file, simply
        specify that file as the argument.)</p>

      <li>
        <a name="shortcut"></a>To have the proxy start itself
        automatically when you login to Win95, drop the
        ``shortcut'' to the <code>junkbstr</code> executable into
        the StartUp folder:<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>C:\Windows\Start

         You might want to change the shortcut's <code>

        Minimized</code>. If you specify the <a href=

    <h3><a name="check"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt="*"
    width="14" height="14">&nbsp; How do I check that the proxy is
    working?</h3>

    <p>Pick a page from somewhere (such as your bookmarks, or just
    one that your browser was pointing to) and <b class="eg">
    Reload</b> it. If you get a message along the lines of ``server
    not responding, using cached copy instead,'' see the advice
    above. If the page reloads OK, check that your browser is
    actually talking to the proxy by going to
    http://internet.junkbuster.com/cgi-bin/show-proxy-args or any
    URL ending in <code>show-proxy-args</code> (as described below,
    the proxy should intercept the request.) When you see
    ``Internet Junkbuster Proxy Status,'' you'll know it's
    working.</p>

    <h3><a name="chain"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt="*"
    width="14" height="14">&nbsp; How and why would I have this
    proxy chained with other proxies?</h3>

    <p>You may need the <a href="ijbman.html#forwardfile">
    forwarding</a> feature to ``daisy chain'' the Internet
    Junkbuster to another proxy, perhaps an anonymizing proxy to
    conceal your IP address, or a caching proxy from your ISP, or a
    firewall proxy between your company and the outside world.
    Version 2.0 and above can be even configured to forward <a
    href="ijbman.html#forwardfile">selectively</a> according to the
    URL requested: for example, connecting directly to trusted
    hosts, but going through an anonymizing or firewall proxy for
    all other hosts.</p>

    <p><a name="administrator"></a>Network administrators might use
    it to provide transparent access to multiple networks without
    modifying browser configurations. <a name="direct"></a>Most
    browsers also provide a way of specifying hosts that the
    browser connects to directly, bypassing the proxy. Some provide
    a method for Automatic Proxy Configuration. A well written
    Internet Junkbuster configuration can be much more flexible and
    powerful.</p>

    <p><a name="example"></a>An ISP's caching proxy would typically
    be called something like <code>cache.your-isp.net:8080</code>
    (as described on you ISP's web page); you would put this
    information in your <a href="ijbman.html#forwardfile">
    forwardfile</a> as described in our manual. Your browser would
    be configured to the Internet Junkbuster for HTTP and Security
    Proxies as before, but you probably want to tell it to use the
    caching proxy for FTP and other protocols. <a name="nonlocal">
    </a>If your ISP is running the Internet Junkbuster for you,
    they have probably already decided whether to chain with a
    caching proxy.</p>

    <h3><a name="socks"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt="*"
    width="14" height="14">&nbsp; How does the Internet Junkbuster
    work with SOCKS gateways?</h3>

    <p>There is support for some gateways in Version 1.4 and above.
    The gateway protocol used to be specified on the command line;
    it is now specified in the same file as <a href=
    "ijbman.html#forwardfile">forwarding.</a> Note that the
    browser's proxy configuration must <em>not</em> specify a
    <code>SOCKS</code> host; it should specify the proxy as
    described above.</p>

    <h3><a name="plain"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt="*"
    width="14" height="14">&nbsp; How do I configure it to be just
    a plain old proxy?</h3>

    <p>To get the proxy to do as little as possible (which means
    not deleting any sensitive headers), place in your
    configuration file the following three lines (each ending in a
    space then a period) to stop it changing sensitive headers:<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>referer .</code><br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>from .</code><br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>user-agent .</code><br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>cookiefile mycookiefile</code><br>
     The fourth line is also needed to specify a <a href=
    "ijbman.html#o_c">cookiefile</a> that might be called <code>
    mycookiefile</code> containing a single line with a <code>
    *</code> character, to allow all cookies through.</p>

    <h3><a name="shutdown"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt="*"
    width="14" height="14">&nbsp; How do I shut down the proxy (to
    restart it)?</h3>

    <p>It depends on your platform.</p>

    <ol type="1">
      <li><a name="X"></a>Under Windows, you can click on the "X"
      button at the top right of the DOS window (and answer <b
      class="eg">Yes</b> when Windows warns you it cannot shut down
      the program automatically), or use <b class="eg">
      Ctrl-Break</b> or the old three-fingered salute of <b class=
      "eg">Ctrl-Alt-Delete</b> and select <b class="eg">End
      Task</b>.</li>

      <li><a name="ps"></a>Under UNIX &reg; you'll need to <code>
      kill</code> the <b><code>junkbuster</code></b> process. <a
      name="pid"></a>If you don't know the process number to give

    think of this kind of technology?</h3>

    <p>We've seen only a few public comments from the advertising
    industry on this, other than SEC filings. First, the president
    of the Internet Advertising Bureau told CNET that he wasn't
    worried by banner blockers. Second, after the Federal Trade
    Commission's workshop where we gave a live demonstration of our
    proxy before many eminent representatives of the industry, the
    Direct Marketing Association made the following statement in
    the closing paragraphs of their summary comments to the
    Commission.</p>

    <blockquote>
      Clever shareware developers have come up with products that
      can obliterate cookies and advertisements for those consumers
      who have these concerns. The Internet is a market that is so
      democratic and flexible that it is easy for companies and
      software developers to respond to a perceived market need.

    <p>Their attitude seems to be that they would prefer that

    width="14" height="14">&nbsp; I run an ISP. What issues should

    <p>Many ISPs who offer the proxy to their customers have told
    us that most of their customers are delighted with it (although
    one reported that a customer complaint that without banner ads,
    surfing was like reading a novel: we recommend making it
    optional). Many ISPs like it because it reduces bandwidth
    requirements. To help get you started, here's a checklist we've
    developed from working with a few ISPs. You may think of more,
    and we'd be interested if you're willing to share them with
    us.</p>

    <ol type="1">
      <li><a name="pending"></a>If you get more than one request
      for the Internet Junkbuster you may want to tell your
      customers on your News page that you already know about it
      and are assessing it.</li>

      <li><a name="try"></a>Try the software and verify that it
      performs satisfactorily.</li>

      <li><a name="value"></a>Determine whether your customers
      perceive the service as valuable (and therefore worth the
      time to set up). We've had reports of many delighted
      customers.</li>

      <li><a name="secure"></a>Assess the level of security
      associated with the software. If access is to be restricted
      (to just dial-in ports, for example) how is this to be
      done?</li>

      <li><a name="costs"></a>Consider whether to expect any
      additional load on computing resources required, and any
      change in use of bandwidth due to the blocking of large
      GIFs.</li>

      <li><a name="opt"></a>Choose the <a href="ijbman.html">
      options</a> you wish to provide.</li>

      <li>
        <a name="multiple"></a>Decide whether you want to offer a
        choice of configurations, such some of these four. 

        <ol type="A">
          <li><a name="banner"></a>Banners Blocked, Wafer with

          <li><a name="kid"></a>A proxy for kids.</li>
        </ol>
        <a name="caching"></a>If you run a caching proxy, decide
        whether the Internet Junkbuster will chain with it by
        default, and whether to offer an alternate with no caching.
        (Some ISPs don't, because they want to give customers an
        incentive to use caching and save bandwidth.)
      </li>

      <li><a name="naming"></a>Decide on a naming scheme for your
      proxies. If you're running only one proxy on one machine, the
      simplest way is to just use port 8000 on your main machine,
      such as <code>our-isp.net.</code> But it would probably be
      safer to put an entry in your name server and call it
      something like <code>junkbuster.our-isp.net.</code> If
      running several proxies, you could either use different ports
      on the same machine, or if you have the opportunity to
      distribute the load over a few machines you could use
      different hostname aliases such as <code>
      banner.junkbuster.our-isp.net</code>, <code>
      lynx.junkbuster.our-isp.net</code> and <code>
      oneway.junkbuster.our-isp.net</code> (corresponding to the
      examples in the previous point). You may want to set up
      Automatic Proxy Configuration.</li>

      <li>
        <a name="document"></a>Prepare a page explaining the
        Internet Junkbuster to your customers. <a name="does"></a>
        Here's are some examples from Australia, Germany, Florida,
        New York/New Jersey/Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Texas,

    <h3><a name="readymade"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt=
    "*" width="14" height="14">&nbsp; Where can I get an example
    blockfile that stops most ads?</h3>

    <p>The sample blockfile we provide blocks almost nothing, and
    we do not publish blockfiles that stop almost all banner ads.
    But others have; you can find them by asking Google. You can
    add any part of the new file to your old one (probably called
    <code>sblock.ini</code> if you haven't changed the default name
    in the latest version) or your just replace it completely. You
    probably don't need to restart the proxy.</p>

    <p><a name="pub"></a>If you develop an interesting blocklist
    and publish it on the Web, you might want to include the word
    ``junkbuster'' in it and use the word ``blocklist'' in the file
    name given in the URL so that others can find it with the query
    given in the previous sentence.</p>

    <h3><a name="zap"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt="*"
    width="14" height="14">&nbsp; If I see an ad I wish I hadn't,
    how do I stop it?</h3>

    <p>If your ISP is running the Internet Junkbuster, they should
    have a policy on whether they accept suggestions from their
    customers on what to block. Consult their web page.</p>

    <p><a name="cover"></a>If you are running the Internet
    Junkbuster yourself, you have complete control over what gets
    through. Just add a pattern to cover the offending URL to your
    blockfile. Version 1.3 and later automatically rereads the
    blockfile when it changes, but if you're running an earlier
    version you'll have to stop it and restart it.</p>

    <p><a name="target"></a>To choose a pattern you'll first need
    to find the URL of the ad you want cover.</p>

    <p><a name="pinpoint"></a>Some people use the <a href=
    "ijbman.html#debug">debug</a> <code>1</code> option to display
    each URL in a window as the request is sent to the server. It's
    then usually an easy task to pick the offending URL from the
    list of recent candidates.</p>

    <p><a name="source"></a>Alternatively, you can use <b class=
    "eg">View Document Info</b> (or <b class="eg">View Document
    Source</b> if your browser doesn't have that). The <b class=
    "eg">Info</b> feature has the advantage of showing you the full
    URL including the host name, which may not be specified in the
    source: there you might see something like <code>
    SRC="/ads/click_here_or_die.gif"</code> indicating only the <i>
    <dfn>path</dfn></i>. (The host name is assumed to be the same
    as the one the page came from.)</p>

    <p><a name="offsite"></a>But ads often come from a different
    site, in which case you might see something like <code>
    SRC="grabem.n.trackem.com/Ad/Infinitum/SpaceID=1666"</code> or
    longer. <a name="warehouse"></a>If the company looks like a
    pure ad warehouse (as in the last case), you may want to place
    just its domain name in the blockfile, which blocks all URLs
    from that site.</p>

    <p><a name="wanted"></a>If the ad comes from a server that you
    really want some content from, you can include enough of the
    path to avoid zapping stuff you might want. In the first
    example above, <code>/ads/</code> would seem to be enough. If
    you don't include the domain name, the pattern applies to all
    sites, so you don't want such patterns to be too general: for
    example <code>/ad</code> would block <code>
    /admin/salaries/</code> on your company's internal site.</p>

    <p><a name="image"></a>To speed the blocking of images, some
    UNIX &reg; users create a shell script called <code>
    Image:</code> containing a line such as <code>echo $1 | sed
    s/http:..// &gt;&gt; $HOME/lib/blockfile</code> that adds its
    argument to the user's blockfile. Once an offending image has
    been be found using <b class="eg">View Document Info</b> it's
    easy to cut-and-paste the line (or part of it) into a shell
    window. The same script can be linked to a file called <code>
    Frame:</code> to dealing with framed documents, and <code>
    junkbuster:</code> to accept the output of the <a href=
    "ijbman.html#debug">debug</a> option.</p>

    <p><a name="partial"></a>When compiled without the <i><dfn>
    regular expressions</dfn></i> option, the Internet Junkbuster
    uses only very simple (and fast) matching methods. The pattern
    <code>/banners</code> will not stop <code>
    /images/banners/huge.gif</code> getting through: you would have
    to include the pattern <code>/images/banners</code> or
    something that matches in full from the left. <a name="regex">
    </a>So you can get what you want here, the matcher understands
    POSIX regular expressions: you can use <code>
    /*.*/banners</code> to block and any URL containing <code>
    /banners</code> (even in the middle of the path). <a name=
    "posix"></a>(In Versions 1.1 through 1.4 they were an option at
    compile time; from Version 2.0 they have become the default.)
    Regular expressions give you many more features than this, but
    if you're not already familiar with them you probably won't
    need to know anything beyond the <code>/*.*/</code> idiom. If
    you do, a <code>man egrep</code> is probably a good starting
    point).</p>

    <p><a name="slash"></a>Don't forget the <code>/</code> (slash)
    at the beginning of the path. If you leave it out the line will
    be interpreted as a domain name, so <code>ad</code> would block
    all sites from Andorra (since <code>.ad</code> is the
    two-letter country code for that principality).</p>

    <p><a name="detail"></a>For a detailed technical description of
    how pattern matching is done, see the <a href=
    "ijbman.html#o_b">manual.</a></p>

    <h3><a name="despite"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt="*"
    width="14" height="14">&nbsp; How come this ad is still getting
    through anyway?</h3>

    <p>If the ad had been displayed before you included its URL in
    the blockfile, it will probably be held in cache for some time,
    so it will be displayed without the need for any request to the
    server. Using the <a href="ijbman.html#debug">debug</a> <code>
    1</code> option to show each URL as it is fetched is a good way
    to see exactly what is happening.</p>

    <p><a name="otherwise"></a>If new items seem to be getting
    through, check that you are really running the proxy with the
    right blockfile in the options. Check the blockfile for
    exceptions.</p>

    <p><a name="java"></a>Some sites may have different ways of
    inserting ads, such as via Java. If you have ideas on how to
    block new kinds of junk not currently covered, please tell
    us.</p>

    <h3><a name="exceptions"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt=
    "*" width="14" height="14">&nbsp; How do I stop it blocking a
    URL that I actually want?</h3>

    <p>You can change the patterns so they don't cover it, or use a
    simple feature in Version 1.1 and later: a line beginning with
    a <code>~</code> character means that a URL blocked by previous
    patterns that matches the rest of the line is let through. For
    example, the pattern <code>/ad</code> would block <code>
    /addasite.html</code> but not if followed by <code>
    ~/addasite</code> in the blockfile. Or suppose you want to see
    everything that comes from a site you like, even if it looks
    like an ad: simply put <code>~aSiteYouLike.com</code> at the
    <em>end</em> of the blockfile. (Order is important, because the
    last matching line wins.)</p>

    <p><a name="agreed"></a>As well as unblocking pages that were
    unintentionally blocked, this feature is useful for unblocking
    ads from a specific source. This might be because you are
    interested in those particular ones, or if you have an explicit
    agreement to accept certain ads, such as those from a free
    web-based email provider.</p>

    <p><a name="blocked"></a>If you want to find out exactly which
    pattern in the blockfile a given URL matched, just click on the
    words ``Internet Junkbuster'' which are displayed alone on a
    page when your browser requests a blocked URL. The proxy
    displays a message that pinpoints the pattern for you.</p>

    <h3><a name="children"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt="*"
    width="14" height="14">&nbsp; Can I block sites I don't want my
    children to see?</h3>

    <p>Yes, but remember that <a name="savvy"></a>children who are
    technically sophisticated enough to use the browsers' proxy
    configuration options could of course bypass any proxy. This
    kind of technology can be used as a gentle barrier to remind or
    guide the child, but nobody should expect it to replace the
    parent's role in setting and enforcing standards of online
    behavior for their children.</p>

    <p><a name="recommend"></a>Some ISPs are starting to provide
    specialized proxies to protect children. There are two basic
    approaches: the ``black list'' and the ``white list'' approach.
    <a name="negative"></a>The black list approach allows the child
    to go anywhere not explicitly prohibited; the white list
    permits visits only to sites explicitly designated as
    acceptable.</p>

    <p><a name="positive"></a>It's very easy for anyone to compile
    a white list from a page of ``recommended kids sites'' and to
    configure an Internet Junkbuster to allow access to those sites
    only. (If you publish such a list on the web, please tell us
    its URL). Assuming your version isn't an old one without regex,
    you can place a <code>*</code> (asterisk) as the first line of
    the blockfile (which blocks everything), and then list
    exceptions after that. Be careful to make the exception
    sufficiently broad: for example, using <code>
    ~www.uexpress.com/ups/comics/ch/</code> as the exception for
    <cite>Calvin and Hobbes</cite> would block some of the graphic
    elements on the page; you would probably want a wider exception
    such as <code>~www.uexpress.com/ups/</code> to permit them.</p>

    <p><a name="trust"></a>Version 2.0 has an experimental feature
    to permit only sites mentioned in a nominated <a href=
    "ijbman.html#trustfile">trusted site.</a> This allows
    organizations to build lists of sites for kids to browse, and
    the software automatically restricts access to those on the
    list.</p>

    <p><a name="scan"></a>Many filtering products actually scan for
    keywords in the text of pages they retrieve before presenting
    it, but the Internet Junkbuster does not do this. Building a
    perfectly reliable black list system is hard, because it's very
    difficult to state in advance exactly what is obscene or
    unsuitable. For more info see our links page.</p>

    <h3><a name="message"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt="*"
    width="14" height="14">&nbsp; What do I see when a page or
    graphic is blocked by the proxy?</h3>

    <p>You usually see a broken image icon, but it depends on
    several factors beyond the proxy's control. If asked for a URL
    matching its blockfile, the proxy returns an HTML page
    containing a message identifying itself (currently the two
    words ``Internet Junkbuster'') with a status 202 (Accepted)
    instead of the usual 200 (OK). (Versions 1.X returned an error
    404: Forbidden, which caused strange behavior in some cases.)
    Status 202 is described in the HTTP RFC as indicating that the
    request has been accepted but not completed, and that it might
    complete successfully in the future (in our case, if the
    blockfile were changed).</p>

    <p><a name="depends"></a>The broken image icon is most common
    because the browser is usually expecting a graphic. But if it
    was expecting text, or if the page happens to be using certain
    HTML extensions such as <code>layer</code> and your browser is
    a late model from Microsoft, you may see the words ``Internet
    Junkbuster'' displayed as a hot link.</p>

    <p><a name="click"></a>Clicking on the link takes you to an
    explanation of the pattern in the blockfile that caused the
    block, so that you can edit the blockfile and go back and
    reload if you really want to see what was blocked. The
    explanatory link is generated by the proxy and is automatically
    intercepted based on its ending in <code>ij-blocked-url</code>;
    even though the site is specified as <code>
    http://internet.junkbuster.com</code> no request should
    actually made to that site. If one is, it means that the proxy
    was been removed after it generated the link.</p>

    <p><a name="layer"></a>To summarize: the identifying link to
    the blocking explanation is usually turned into a broken image
    icon, but it may be displayed on a page alone, or they may may
    be restricted to the particular frame, layer or graphic area
    specified in the page containing them. The proxy has no way of
    knowing the context in which a URL will be used and cannot
    control how the blocking message will be rendered.</p>

    <h3><a name="broken"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt="*"
    width="14" height="14">&nbsp; Why not replace blocked banners
    with something invisible?</h3>

    <p><a name="infringe"></a>Many users have suggested to us that
    blocked banners should be replaced by a something like a 1x1
    transparent GIF to make the page would look as if there was
    nothing ever there. Apart from making it harder to catch
    unintended blocking, this might also displease the owners of
    the page, who could argue that such a change constitutes a
    copyright infringement. We think that merely failing to allow
    an included graphic to be accessed would probably not be
    considered an infringement: after all this is what happens when
    a browser is configured not to load images automatically.
    However, we are not lawyers, so anyone in doubt should take
    appropriate advice.</p>

    <p><a name="done"></a>In a context where the copyright issue is
    resolved satisfactorily, a proxy could simply return a status
    301 or 302 and specify a replacement URL in a <code>
    Location</code> and/or <code>URI</code> header. An alternative
    would be to use inline code to return a 1 x 1 clear GIF. We do
    not publish sample code for this, and we have no way of
    stopping others who have.</p>

    <h3><a name="size"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt="*"
    width="14" height="14">&nbsp; Why not block banners based on
    the dimensions of the image?</h3>

    <p>Many users have pointed out that most banner ads come in
    standard sizes, so why not block all GIFs of those sizes? This
    would theoretically be without fetching the object because the
    dimensions are usually given in the <code>IMG</code> tag, but
    it would require substantial changes in the code, and we doubt
    whether it would be much more effective than a good block
    list.</p>

    <h3><a name="embedded"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt="*"
    width="14" height="14">&nbsp; What about non-graphic
    advertising within the pages I want?</h3>

    <p>The Internet Junkbuster deliberately does not provide a way
    of automatically editing the contents of a page, to remove
    textual advertising or to repair the holes left by blocked
    banners. Other packages such as WebFilter do.</p>

    <p><a name="base"></a>For the same reason, it has no way of
    stopping a new browser window being created, because this is
    done through the <code>target</code> attribute in the <code>
    &lt;a&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;base&gt;</code> elements, not
    through headers. Nor do we plan to add a feature to paralyze
    animated GIFs.</p>

    <h3><a name="push"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt="*"
    width="14" height="14">&nbsp; Does it block ads on the
    broadcasting ``push'' systems? How about pop-up ads?</h3>

    <p>We haven't tried it but we expect it would probably work on
    image ads on push channels. See also adchoice.</p>

    <p><a name="pop"></a>Disabling Javascript stops some pop-up
    ads. One problem is that some advertisers throw open a new
    browser window to frame the ad. The ad is easily blocked, but
    the empty window remains. You can kill it easily, but this is a
    chore. We don't see how to stop them other than editing the
    HTML from the parent window, which we don't like to do.</p>

    <p><a name="TBTD"></a>The TBTF newsletter warned subscribers to
    push information that <a name="LOGTARGET"></a>in IE4, LOGTARGET
    allows servers to determine the URLs viewed at their site even
    if accessed from cache or through a proxy. If you use this
    browser see our instructions on how to disable this.</p>

    <p><a name="pushy"></a>If you find you have experience using
    the proxy with push, or have any other advice about it, please

    <h3><a name="breakthrough"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif"
    alt="*" width="14" height="14">&nbsp; Might some cookies still
    get through? How can I stop them?</h3>

    <p>Yes, you should expect the occasional cookie to make it
    through to your browser. We know of at least three ways this
    can happen; please tell us if you find any others. One way is
    in secure documents, which are explained below.</p>

    <p><a name="EQUIV"></a>A few sites set cookies using a line
    such as <code>&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV="Set-Cookie"
    CONTENT="flavor=chocolate"&gt;</code> in the <code>HEAD</code>
    section of an HTML document. <a name="javascript"></a>Cookies
    can also be 
    <!-- IEM: http://cgi.netscape.com/eng/mozilla/Gold/handbook/javascript/ref_a-c.html#cookie_property -->
    set and read in JavaScript. To see if this is happening in a
    document, view its source, look in the <code>head</code> for a
    section tagged <code>script language="JavaScript"</code>. If it
    contains a reference to <code>document.cookie</code>, the page
    can manipulate your cookie file without sending any cookie
    headers. The Internet Junkbuster does not tamper with these
    methods. Fortunately they are rarely used at the moment. If a
    cookie gets set, it should be stopped by the proxy on its way
    back to the server when a page is requested, but it can still
    be read in Javascript.</p>

    <p><a name="alert"></a>To prevent cookies breaking through,
    <strong>always</strong> keep cookie alerts turned on in your
    browser, and disable Java and Javascript. Making the files hard
    to write may also help.</p>

    <h3><a name="method"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt="*"
    width="14" height="14">&nbsp; Exactly how do cookies get
    created and stored anyway?</h3>

    <p>When a web site's server sends you a page it also sends
    certain ``header information'' which your browser records but
    does not display. One of these is a <code>Set-Cookie</code>
    header, which specifies the cookie information that the server
    wants your browser to record. Similarly, when your browser
    requests a page it also sends headers, specifying information
    such as the graphics formats it understands. If a cookie has
    previously been set by a site that matches the URL it is about
    to request, your browser adds a <code>Cookie</code> header
    quoting the previous information.</p>

    <p><a name="privacy"></a>For more background information on how
    cookies can damage your privacy, see our page on cookies. For
    highly detailed technical information see the RFC. The Internet
    Junkbuster will show you all headers you use the <a href=
    "ijbman.html#debug">debug</a> <code>8</code> option, or you can
    get a sample from our demonstration page.</p>

    <h3><a name="break"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt="*"
    width="14" height="14">&nbsp; If cookies can't get through,
    will some things stop working for me?</h3>

    <p>Possibly. Some personalized services including certain 
    <!-- IEM: http://my.yahoo.com --> chat rooms require cookies.
    <a name="registration"></a>Newspapers that require 
    <!-- IEM: http://www.nytimes.com/subscribe/sub-bin/new_sub.cgi#agree -->
    registration or 
    <!-- IEM: http://interactive5.wsj.com/regUser.html -->
    subscription will not automatically recognize you if you don't
    send them the cookie they assigned you. And there are a very
    small number of sites that do strange things with cookies; they
    don't work for anyone that blocks cookies by any means. Some
    sites such as Microsoft explain that their content is so
    wonderfully compelling that they will withhold it from you
    unless you submit to their inserting cookies.</p>

    <p><a name="hotmail"></a>Many free Web-based email services
    require cookies. Hotmail also seems to require allowing both
    <code>msn.com</code> and <code>passport.com</code> to set
    cookies.</p>

    <p><a name="want"></a>If you want such sites to be given your
    cookies, you can use the <a href="ijbman.html#cookiefile">
    cookiefile</a> option provided you are running Version 1.2 or
    later yourself. Simply include the domain name of those sites
    in the <i>cookiefile</i> specified by this option. If it still
    doesn't work, the problem may be in other headers.</p>

    <p><a name="one"></a>It's possible to let cookies out but not
    in, which is enough to keep some sites happy, but not all of
    them: one newspaper site seems to go into an endless frenzy if
    deprived of fresh cookies. A cookiefile containing a single
    line consisting of the two characters <code>&gt;*</code>
    (greater-than and star) permits server-bound cookies only. The
    <code>*</code> is a <a href="ijbman.html#wildcard">wildcard</a>
    that matches all domains.</p>

    <p><a name="else"></a>If someone else is running the Internet
    Junkbuster for you and has a version that 
    <!-- IAM: ijbfaq.html#registration --> passes server-bound
    cookies through, you can try editing your browser's cookie file
    to contain just the ones you want, and restart your browser. <a
    name="window"></a>To subscribe to a new service like this after
    you have started using the Internet Junkbuster, you can try the
    following: tell your browser to stop using the Internet
    Junkbuster, fill out and submit your subscription details
    (allowing that web site to set a cookie), then reconfigure your
    browser to use the Internet Junkbuster again (and stop more
    cookies being sent). This also requires the <a href=
    "ijbman.html#cookiefile">cookiefile</a> option, and its success
    depends on the Web site not wanting to change your cookies at
    every session. For this reason it does not work at some major
    newspaper sites, for example. <a name="buyers"></a>But you may
    prefer to look at whether other sites provide the same or
    better services without demanding the opportunity to track your
    behavior. The web is a buyer's market where most prices are
    zero: very few people pay for content with money, so why should
    you pay with your privacy?</p>

    <h3><a name="crumble"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt="*"
    width="14" height="14">&nbsp; Can I control cookies on a
    per-site basis?</h3>

    <p><a name="discard"></a>Yes, since version 1.2 the Internet
    Junkbuster has included advanced cookie management facilities.
    Unless you specify otherwise, cookies are discarded
    (``crumbled'') by the Internet Junkbuster whether they came
    from the server or the browser. In Version 1.2 and later you
    can use the <a href="ijbman.html#cookiefile">cookiefile</a>

    </p>

    <ol type="1">
      <li><a name="fed"></a>Cookies sent from servers in the domain
      <code>send-user-cookies.org</code> are blocked on their way
      to the client, but cookies sent by the browser to that domain
      are still be fed to them.</li>

      <li><a name="take"></a>The cookies of <code>
      accept-server-cookies.org</code> check in to the proxy and
      are passed through to the browser, but when they come back to
      the proxy they never check out.</li>

      <li><a name="deny"></a>All cookies to and from <code>

    </ol>

    <p><a name="paths"></a>If the <b><code>junkbuster</code></b>
    was compiled with the regular expressions option they may be
    used in paths. Any logging to a ``cookie jar'' is separate and
    not affected.</p>

    <p><a name="breadth"></a>It's important to give hosts you want
    to be able to set cookies sufficient breadth. For example,
    instead of <code>www.yahoo.com</code> use <code>
    yahoo.com</code> because the company uses many different hosts
    ending in that domain.</p>

    <h3><a name="wafers"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt="*"
    width="14" height="14">&nbsp; Can I make up my own fake cookies
    (wafers) to feed to servers?</h3>

    <p>Yes, using the <a href="ijbman.html#wafer">wafer</a> option.
    We coined the term <i><dfn>wafer</dfn></i> to describe cookies
    chosen by a user, not the Web server. Servers may not find
    wafers as tasty as the cookies they make themselves. But users
    may enjoy controlling servers' diets for various reasons, such
    as the following.</p>

    <ol type="1">
      <li><a name="retaliate"></a>Users who consider cookies to be
      an unwelcome intrusion and a waste of their disk space can
      respond in kind. By writing ``signature wafers'' they can
      express their feelings about cookies, in a place that the
      people in charge of them are most likely to notice.</li>

      <li>
        <a name="notice"></a>Sites running a proxy that logs
        cookies to a file (such as the Internet Junkbuster does
        with the <a href="ijbman.html#jarfile">jarfile</a> option
        on) may want to notify servers that their cookies are being
        intercepted, deleted or copied. One possible reason for
        doing this is the uncertain copyright status of cookie
        strings. Nothing here should be taken as legal advice: we
        are simply raising a question for any interested parties to
        consider, and make no representation that such measures are
        necessary or sufficient. Concerned proxy sites might decide
        to send a wafer (named ``NOTICE'' for example) containing
        text along the lines of the following. 

        <blockquote>
          <p><a name="licenses_on_cookies_refused"></a>TO WHOM IT
          MAY CONCERN<i><br>
          <br>
           Do not send me any copyrighted information other than
          the document that I am requesting or any of its necessary
          components.<br>
          <br>
           In particular do not send me any cookies that are
          subject to a claim of copyright by anybody. Take notice
          that I refuse to be bound by any license condition
          (copyright or otherwise) applying to any cookie.</i></p>
        </blockquote>
        Any company that tries to argue in court that the proxy
        site was breaching their copyright in the cookies would be
        met with the defense that the proxy site gave that company
        the opportunity to protect its copyright by simply not
        sending cookies after receiving the notice. 

        <p><a name="pointer"></a>Cookies can be as long as four
        thousand characters, so there's plenty of space for
        lawyerly verbosity, but white space, commas, and
        semi-colons are <a href="ijbman.html#o_w">prohibited.</a>
        Spaces can be turned into underscores. Alternatively, a URL
        could be sent as the cookie value, pointing to a document
        containing a notice, perhaps with a suggestive value such
        as<br>
         <code>
        http://www.junkbusters.com/ht/en/ijbfaq.html#licenses_on_cookies_refused</code><br>

         But including the notice directly would probably be
        preferable because the addressee does not have to look it
        up.</p>

        <p><a name="vanilla"></a>The Internet Junkbuster 2.0.2
        currently sends a full notice as a ``vanilla wafer'' if
        cookies are being logged to a cookie jar and no other
        wafers have been specified. It can be suppressed with the
        <a href="ijbman.html#suppress-vanilla-wafer">
        suppress-vanilla-wafer</a> option, which might be used in
        situations where there is an established understanding
        between the proxy and all who serve it.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p><a name="gimme"></a>Junkbusters provides a CGI script that
    lets you see your wafers as they appear to servers.</p>

    <p><a name="malfunction"></a>Wafers confuse a few fragile
    servers. Hotmail appears to be one of them. If this troubles
    you, don't use this option.</p>

    <p><a name="regardless"></a>Any wafers specified are sent to
    all sites regardless of the cookiefile. <a name="compliant">
    </a> They are appended after any genuine cookies, to maintain
    compliance with RFC 2109 in the event that a path was specified
    for a cookie. The RFC's provisions regarding the <code>$</code>
    character (such as the <code>Version</code> attribute) are
    transparent to the proxy; it simply quotes what was recited by
    the browser.</p>

    <p><a name="personalize"></a>If you want to send wafers only to
    specific sites, you could try putting them your browser's
    cookie file in a format conforming to the Netscape
    specification, and then specify in the proxy's cookiefile that
    cookies are to be sent to but not accepted from those sites, so
    they can't overwrite the file. This may work with Netscape but
    not all other browsers.</p>

    <h3><a name="jar"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt="*"
    width="14" height="14">&nbsp; Why would anyone want to save
    their cookies in a ``cookie jar?''</h3>

    <p>We provided this capability just in case anyone wants it.
    There are a few possible reasons.</p>

    <ol type="1">
      <li><a name="pay"></a>It's conceivable that marketing
      companies might one day buy history files and cookie jars
      from consumers in the same way that they currently pay them
      to fill out survey forms. With this information they could
      gather psychographic information, see which competitors'
      sites the consumer has visited, and discover what advertising
      is being targeted at them.</li>

      <li><a name="choose"></a>Some consumers might employ
      semi-automated means of sorting through their cookie jars,
      selecting which ones to place in their cookies file for use
      by their browsers. Their decisions could be based on payments
      offered, privacy rating systems such as TRUSTe proposes, or
      their own opinion of the company. It could be done manually
      or with software. There's an Internet Draft on trust
      certification of cookies.</li>

      <li><a name="share"></a>Users may even start ``sharing''
      cookies among themselves, sending back cookies that servers
      generated for other visitors. Servers that aren't expecting
      this possibility will be misled about their visitors'
      identities. Cookies could be shared among users on a single
      machine, or across continents via FTP and anonymous
      remailers. <a name="disinformation"></a>Privacy activists may
      promote cookie disinformation campaigns as a way to defend
      the public against abuse. If a significant percentage of
      people send disinformative cookies, user tracking via cookies
      may become less reliable and less used.</li>
    </ol>

    <p align="center"><a href="#top_of_page"><img border="0" src=
    "top.gif" alt="--- Back to Top of Page ---" width="250" height=
    "15"></a></p>

    <h2><a name="anonymity"></a> Anonymity</h2>

    <p>For details on how your identity can be revealed while you
    surf, see our page on privacy. Once you start using the
    Internet Junkbuster you should find that much of the
    information previously indicated on that page will no longer be
    provided. If the <code>REMOTE HOST</code> indicating your IP
    address is too close for comfort, see our suggestions below on
    how to conceal your IP address. We also recommend that you
    disable JavaScript and Java.</p>

    <h3><a name="disclose"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt="*"
    width="14" height="14">&nbsp; If I use the Internet Junkbuster,
    will my anonymity be guaranteed?</h3>

    <p>No. Your chances of remaining anonymous are improved, but
    unless you are an expert on Internet security it would be
    safest to assume that everything you do on the Web can be
    attributed to you personally.</p>

    <p><a name="happen"></a>The Internet Junkbuster removes various
    information about you, but it's still possible that web sites
    can find out who you are. Here's one way this can happen.</p>

    <p><a name="ftp"></a>A few browsers disclose the user's email
    address in certain situations, such as when transferring a file
    by FTP. The Internet Junkbuster 2.0.2 does not filter the FTP
    stream. If you need this feature, or are concerned about the
    mail handler of your browser disclosing your email address, you
    might consider products such as NSClean.</p>

    <p><a name="binaries"></a>Browsers downloaded as binaries could
    use non-standard headers to give out any information they can
    have access to: see the manufacturer's license agreement. It's
    impossible to anticipate and prevent every breach of privacy
    that might occur. The professionally paranoid prefer browsers
    available as source code, because anticipating their behavior
    is easier.</p>

    <h3><a name="should"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt="*"
    width="14" height="14">&nbsp; Why should I trust my ISP or
    Junkbusters with my browsing data?</h3>

    <p>You shouldn't have to trust us, and you certainly don't have
    to. We do not run the proxy as a service, where we could
    observe your online behavior. We provide source code so that
    everyone can see that the proxy isn't doing anything
    sneaky.</p>

    <p><a name="awful"></a>You are already trusting your ISP not to
    look at an awful lot of information on what you do. They
    probably post a privacy policy on their site to reassure you.
    If they run a proxy for you, using it could actually make it
    slightly easier for them to monitor you, but we doubt that any
    sane ISP would try this, because if it were discovered
    customers would desert them.</p>

    <h3><a name="logging"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt="*"
    width="14" height="14">&nbsp; Can the proxy be used for logging
    who looks at what?</h3>

    <p>We don't want institutions to use this software as an
    instrument of surveillance. We have deliberately not provided
    options to add timestamps or records of which IP addresses
    accessed which URLs. However, because we publish source code
    anyone can modify it to do such things, and there is no way a
    remote user can find out if this is happening. Again, you need
    to be able to trust the entity providing your proxy service,
    but you were probably in that position even before using a
    proxy.</p>

    <h3><a name="header"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt="*"
    width="14" height="14">&nbsp; What private information from
    server-bound headers is removed?</h3>

    <p>The Internet Junkbuster pounces on the following HTTP
    headers in requests to servers, unless instructed otherwise in
    the options.</p>

    <ol type="1">
      <li><a name="from"></a>The <code>FROM</code> header, which a
      few browsers use to tell your email address to servers, is
      dropped unless the <a href="ijbman.html#from">from</a> option
      is set.</li>

      <li><a name="agent"></a>The <code>USER_AGENT</code> <a name=
      "infer"></a>header is changed to indicate that the browser is
      currently Mozilla (Netscape) 3.01 Gold with an unremarkable
      Macintosh configuration. Misidentification helps resist
      certain attacks. If your browser and hardware happen to be
      accurately identified, you might want to change the default.
      (Earlier versions of the Internet Junkbuster indicated
      different details; by altering them periodically we aim to
      hinder anyone trying to infer whether our proxy is present.)
      <a name="lying"></a>If you don't like the idea of incorrectly
      identifying your computer as a Mac, set it accordingly. 
      <!-- Aside: or read Kundera's Unbearable Lightness of Being, 5:5, ``It is a tragicomic fact..'' (p187?) --></li>

      <li><a name="referer"></a>The <code>REFERER</code> header
      (which indicates where the URL currently being requested was
      found) is dropped. A single static referer to replace all
      real referers may be specified using the <a href=
      "ijbman.html#referer">referer</a> option. Where no referer is
      provided by the browser, none is added; the <a href=
      "ijbman.html#add-header">add-header</a> option with arguments
      such as <code>-x 'Referer: http://me.me.me'</code> can be
      used to send a bogus referer with every request.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>In Version 1.4 and later you can use the <a href=
    "ijbman.html#o_r">-r @</a> option to selectively disclose
    <code>REFERER</code> and <code>USER_AGENT</code> to only those
    sites you nominate.</p>

    <p><a name="UA"></a>Some browsers send Referer and User-Agent
    information under different non-standard headers. The Internet
    Junkbuster 2.0.2 stops <code>UA</code> headers, but others may
    get through. This information is also available via JavaScript,
    so disable it. <a name="indexers"></a>Some search engines
    encode the query you typed in the URL that goes to advertisers
    to target a banner ad at you, so you will need to block the ad
    as well as the referer header, unless you want them (and anyone
    they might buy data from) to know everything you ever search
    for.</p>

    <p><a name="JavaScript"></a>If you have JavaScript enabled (the
    default on most browsers) servers can use it to obtain Referer
    and User Agent, as well as your plug-ins. We recommend
    disabling JavaScript and Java.</p>

    <p><a name="response"></a>Currently no HTTP response headers
    (browser bound) are removed, not even the <code>
    Forwarded:</code> or <code>X-Forwarded-For:</code> headers. Nor
    are any added, <a href="ijbman.html#o_y">unless requested.</a>
    We are considering a more flexible header management system for
    a future version.</p>

    <h3><a name="breakage"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt="*"
    width="14" height="14">&nbsp; Might some things break because
    header information is changed?</h3>

    <p>Possibly. If used with a browser less advanced than Netscape
    3.0 or IE-3, indicating an advanced browser may encourage pages
    containing extensions that confuse your browser. If this
    becomes a problem upgrade your browser or use the <a href=
    "ijbman.html#user-agent">user-agent</a> option to indicate an
    older browser. In Version 1.4 and later you can selectively
    reveal your real browser to only those sites you nominate.</p>

    <p><a name="Russian"></a>Because different browsers use
    different encodings of Russian and Czech characters, certain
    web servers convert pages on-the-fly according to the User
    Agent header. Giving a User Agent with the wrong operating
    system or browser manufacturer causes some sites in these
    languages to be garbled; Surfers to Eastern European sites
    should <a href="ijbman.html#o_r">change it</a> to something
    closer.</p>

    <p><a name="counters"></a>Some page access counters work by
    looking at the referer; they may fail or break when
    deprived.</p>

    <p><a name="wired"></a>Some sites depend on getting a referer
    header, such as <code>uclick.com</code>, which serves comic
    strips for many newspaper sites, including <cite>
    Doonsbury</cite> for the <cite>Washington Post.</cite> (If you
    click on that last link, you can then get to a page containing
    the strip via the same URL we've linked to under <cite>
    Doonsbury</cite>, but if you click on the <cite>
    Doonsbury</cite> link directly, it gives you an error message
    suggesting that you use a browser that supports referers.) In
    Version 1.4 and later you can use the <a href=
    "ijbman.html#o_r">-r @</a> option and place a line like <code>
    &gt;uclick.com</code> in your cookiefile. Wired News used to
    use referer to decide whether to add a navigation column to the
    page, but they have changed that.</p>

    <p><a name="Intellicast"></a>The weather maps of Intellicast
    have been blocked by their server when no referer or cookie is
    provided. You can use the same countermeasure with a line such
    as <code>&gt;208.194.150.32</code> (or simply get your weather
    information elsewhere).</p>

    <p><a name="decide"></a>Some software vendors, including
    Download.com and Intuit use <code>USER_AGENT</code> to decide
    which versions of their products to display to you. With the
    default you get Mac versions.</p>

    <p><a name="resort"></a>As a last resort if a site you need
    doesn't seem to be working, the proxy configuration of many
    browsers allow you to specify <b class="eg">No Proxy For</b>
    any hostname you want.</p>

    <p><a name="What"></a>We had reports that on some versions of
    Netscape the What's New feature did not work with the proxy,
    but we think we fixed this in Version 2.0.1.</p>

    <h3><a name="misidentify"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt=
    "*" width="14" height="14">&nbsp; How is misidentifying my
    browser good for security and privacy?</h3>

    <p>Almost every major release of both leading browsers has
    contained bugs that allow malicious servers to compromise your
    privacy and security. Known bugs are quickly fixed, but
    millions of copies of the affected software remain out there,
    and yours is probably one of them. The header that normally
    identifies your browser tells such servers exactly which
    attacks to use against you. By misidentifying your browser you
    reduce the likelihood that they will be able to mount a
    successful attack.</p>

    <h3><a name="conceal"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt="*"
    width="14" height="14">&nbsp; Does the Internet Junkbuster
    conceal my IP address?</h3>

    <p>Web sites get the IP address of any proxy or browser they
    serve pages to. If you run the proxy on your own computer the
    IP address disclosed is the same as your browser would, unless
    you use the <a href="ijbman.html#forwardfile">forwardfile</a>
    option is used to chain to another proxy, in which case servers
    only get the last IP address in the chain. Chaining slightly
    slows browsing of course, but it improves anonymity.</p>

    <h3><a name="ident"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt="*"
    width="14" height="14">&nbsp; Does the Internet Junkbuster
    thwart identification by identd?</h3>

    <p>We think so, provided you are not the user running the
    proxy. If your computer (or your ISP's) is running the <code>
    identd</code> demon, servers can ask it for the identity of the
    user making the request at time you request a page from them.
    But if you're going through a proxy, they will identify the
    user name associated with the proxy, not you. A visit to
    http://ident.junkbusters.com lets you see what's happening.
    This test is (quite rightly) blocked by many firewalls; just
    interrupt the transfer if you get an abnormal wait after
    clicking. Running other applications may also expose you via
    <code>identd</code>; the proxy of course doesn't help then.</p>

    <h3><a name="detect"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt="*"
    width="14" height="14">&nbsp; Can web sites tell that I'm using
    the Internet Junkbuster?</h3>

    <p>With the default options the proxy doesn't announce itself.
    Obvious indications such as Keep-Alive headers are <a href=
    "ijbman.html#o_x">deleted,</a> but sites might notice that you
    can cancel cookies faster than any human could possibly click
    on a mouse. (If you want to provide a plausible explanation for
    this, change the User Agent header to a cookie-free or
    cookie-crunching browser).</p>

    <p><a name="figure"></a>But when certain options are used they
    could figure out something's going on, even if they're not
    pushing cookies. If you use blocking they can tell from their
    logs that the graphics in their pages are not being requested
    selectively. The <a href="ijbman.html#add-forwarded-header">
    add-forwarded-header</a> option explicitly announces to the
    server that a proxy is present, and sending them wafers is of
    course a dead giveaway.</p>

    Documents (SSL, https:)?</h3>

    <p>If you enter a ``Secure Document Area,'' cookies and other
    header information such as User Agent and Referer are sent
    encrypted, so they cannot be filtered. We recommend getting
    your browser to alert you when this happens. (On Netscape: <b

    <code>:443</code> to the blockfile to stop all but sites
    specified in an exception after that line from using SSL.</p>

    <p><a name="passage"></a>It may be possible to filter encrypted
    cookies by combining the blocking proxy with a cryptographic

    Eavesdroppers (including proxies) can see where your messages
    are going whether you are running a proxy or not, but they only
    get to see the contents after they have been encrypted.</p>

    <h3><a name="restrict"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt="*"
    width="14" height="14">&nbsp; Can I restrict use of the proxy
    to a set of nominated IP addresses?</h3>

    <p>Yes, we added an <a href="ijbman.html#aclfile">access
    control</a> file in Version 2.0. But before you use it please
    consider why you want to do it. If the reason is security, it
    probably means you need a firewall.</p>

    <p><a name="selective"></a>The <a href=
    "ijbman.html#listen-address">listen-address</a> option provides
    a way of binding the proxy to a single IP address/port. The
    right way to do this is to choose a port inside your firewall,
    and deny access to it to those outside the firewall. The
    Internet Junkbuster is not a firewall proxy; it should not be
    expected to solve security problems.</p>

    <p><a name="firewall"></a>For background information on
    firewalls, see Yahoo or a magazine article or these well-known
    books: <cite>Firewalls and Internet Security: Repelling the
    Wily Hacker</cite> by William R. Cheswick and Steven M.
    Bellovin or <cite>Building Internet Firewalls</cite> by D.
    Brent Chapman and Elizabeth D. Zwicky. There's 
    <!-- IEM: http://www.wmd.de/wmd/staff/pauck/misc/fwtk_on_linux.html -->
    free Linux software available, and a large number of commercial
    products and services. For an excellent security overview,
    primer, and compendium reference, see <cite>Practical Unix and
    Internet Security</cite> by Simson Garfinkel and Gene
    Spafford.</p>

    <h3><a name="others"></a><img border="0" src="fb.gif" alt="*"
    width="14" height="14">&nbsp; Are there any security risks for
    ISPs or others who offer the proxy?</h3>

    <p>Yes. As with any service offered over the Internet, hackers
    can try to misuse it. A well-run ISP will have professionals
    who are experienced at assessing and containing these
    risks.</p>

    <p><a name="outside"></a>It's possible to set up your machine
    so that other people can have access to your proxy, but if you
    lack expertise in computer security you probably shouldn't have
    your computer configured to offer this or any other service to
    the outside world.</p>

    <p><a name="attack"></a>Hackers can attempt to gain access to
    the machine by various attacks, which we have tried to guard
    against but don't guarantee to thwart. They can also use the
    ``anonymizing'' quality of proxies to try to cover their tracks
    while hacking other computers. For this reason we recommend
    preventing it being used as an anonymous <code>telnet</code> by
    putting the pattern <code>:23</code> in the blockfile (it's
    included as standard equipment). (Actually the current
    implementation incidentally blocks telnet due to the way
    headers are handled, but it's best not to rely on this.) If you
    wish to block all ports except the default HTTP port 80, you
    can put the lines<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>:</code><br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>~:80</code><br>
     at the beginning of the blockfile, but be aware that some
    servers run on non-default ports (e.g. 8080). You might also
    want to add the line <code>~:443</code> to allow SSL.</p>

    <p><a name="root"></a>On UNIX &reg; systems it is neither
    necessary nor desirable for the proxy to run as root.</p>

    <p><a name="patched"></a>Versions 2.0.1 and below may be
    vulnerable to remote exploitation of a memory buffer bug; for
    security reasons all users are encouraged to upgrade.</p>

    <p><a name="holes"></a>If you find any security holes in the
    code please tell us, along with any suggestions you may have
    for fixing it. However, we do not claim that we will be able to
    do so.</p>
