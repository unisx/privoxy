<sect1 id="general"><title>General Information</title>
<sect2 renderas="sect3" id="who_uses"><title>Who should use Privoxy?</title>
 <para>
  Anyone that is interested in security, privacy, or in 
  finer-grained control over their web and Internet experience.
  Everyone is encouraged to try &my-app;.
 </para>
</sect2>

<sect2 renderas="sect3" id="bestchoice"><title>Is Privoxy the best choice for
me?</title>
 <para>
  &my-app; is certainly a good choice, especially for those who want more 
  control and security. Those that have the ability to fine-tune their installation
  will benefit the most. One of <application>Privoxy's</application>
  strength's is that it is highly configurable giving you the ability to
  completely personalize your installation. Being familiar with, or at least
  having an interest in learning about <ulink
  url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Http">HTTP</ulink> and other networking
  protocols, <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Html">HTML</ulink>, 
  <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol">IP (Internet
  Protocol)</ulink>, and 
  <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expressions"><quote>Regular
  Expressions</quote></ulink>
  will be a big plus and will help you get the most out 
  of &my-app;.
 </para>
 <para>
  Much of <application>Privoxy's</application> configuration can be done 
  with a  <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">Web browser</ulink>.
  But there are areas where configuration is done using a 
  <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editors">text editor</ulink>
  to edit configuration files.
  </para>
</sect2>

<sect2 renderas="sect3" id="proxymoron"><title>What is a <quote>proxy</quote>? How does
Privoxy work? </title>
 <para>
  A  <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server">web proxy</ulink>
  is a service, based on a software such as
  <application>Privoxy</application>, that clients (i.e. browsers) can use
  instead of connecting directly to web servers on the Internet. The
  clients then ask the proxy to fetch the objects they need (web pages,
  images, movies etc) on their behalf, and when the proxy has done so, it
  hands the results back to the client. It is a <quote>go-between</quote>. See
  the <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server">Wikipedia proxy
  definition</ulink> for more.
 </para>
 <para>
  There are many reasons to use web proxies, such as security (firewalling),
  efficiency (caching) and others, and there are any number of proxies
  to accommodate those needs.
 </para>
 <para>
  <application>Privoxy</application> is a proxy that is primarily focused on privacy
  protection, ad and junk elimination and freeing the user from restrictions placed on his 
  activities. Sitting between your browser(s) and the Internet,
  it is in a perfect position to filter outbound personal information that your
  browser is leaking, as well as inbound junk. It uses a variety of techniques to do
  this, all of which are under your complete control via the various configuration
  files and options.
 </para>

<sect2 renderas="sect3">
<title id="whyprivoxy">Why <quote>Privoxy</quote>? Why change the name from
Junkbuster at all?</title>
<para>
 <ulink url="http://junkbusters.com/">Junkbusters Corporation</ulink>
 continues to offer their original version of the <application>Internet
 Junkbuster</application>, so publishing our
 <application> Junkbuster</application>-derived software under the same name
 led to confusion.
</para>
<para>
 There are also potential legal complications from the continued use of the 
 <application>Junkbuster</application> name, which is a registered trademark of 
 <ulink url="http://junkbusters.com/">Junkbusters Corporation</ulink>.
 There are, however, no objections from Junkbusters Corporation to the 
 <application>Privoxy</application> project itself, and they, in fact, still
 share our ideals and goals.
</para>
<para>
 The developers also believed that there are so many improvements over the original 
 code, that it was time to make a clean break from the past and make 
 a name in their own right.
</para>
<para>
 <application>Privoxy</application> is the 
 <quote><emphasis>Privacy Enhancing Proxy</emphasis></quote>. Also, its content
 modification and junk suppression gives <emphasis>you</emphasis>, the user, more
 control, more freedom, and allows you to browse your personal and
 <quote><emphasis>private</emphasis> edition</quote> of the web.
</para>
</sect2>


<sect2 renderas="sect3" id="differs"><title>How does Privoxy differ
from the old Junkbuster?</title> 
<para>
 <application>Privoxy</application> picks up where
 <application>Junkbuster</application> left off. All the old features remain.
 The new <application>Privoxy</application> still blocks ads and banners,
 still manages <ulink
 url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_cookie">cookies</ulink>, and still
 helps protect your privacy. But, these are all greatly enhanced, and many,
 many new features have been added, all in the same vein.
 </para>
 <para>
 The configuration has changed significantly as well. This is something that
 users will notice right off the bat if upgrading from 
 <application>Junkbuster</application> 2.0.x. The <quote>blocklist</quote>
 <quote>cookielist</quote>, <quote>imagelist</quote> and much more has been
 combined into the <quote>actions</quote> files, with a completely different
 syntax. <![%p-newstuff;[ See the <ulink url="../user-manual/whatsnew.html">What's New</ulink> 
 page for the latest updates.]]>
</para>
<para>
 <application>Privoxy</application>'s new features include:
</para>

<!-- Include newfeatures.sgml: --> 
 &newfeatures;
<!-- end include -->

</sect2>

<sect2 renderas="sect3" id="whatsanad">
<title id="knows">How does Privoxy know what is
an ad, and what is not?</title>
<para>
 <application>Privoxy</application>'s approach to blocking ads is twofold:
</para>
<para>
 First, there are certain patterns in the <emphasis>locations</emphasis> (URLs)
 of banner images. This applies to both the path (you wouldn't guess how many
 web sites serve their banners from a directory called <quote>banners</quote>!)
 and the host (blocking the big banner hosting services like doublecklick.net
 already helps a lot). <application>Privoxy</application> takes advantage of this
 fact by using <ulink url="../user-manual/actions-file.html#AF-PATTERNS">URL
 patterns</ulink> to sort out and block the requests for things that sound 
 like they would be ads or banners.
</para>
<para>
 Second, banners tend to come in certain <emphasis>sizes</emphasis>. But you
 can't tell the size of an image by its URL without downloading it, and if you
 do, it's too late to save bandwidth. Therefore, <application>Privoxy</application>
 also inspects the HTML sources of web pages while they are loaded, and replaces
 references to images with standard banner sizes by dummy references, so that
 your browser doesn't request them anymore in the first place.
</para>
<para>
 Both of this involves a certain amount of guesswork and is, of course, freely
 and readily configurable.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 renderas="sect3">
<title id="mistakes">Can Privoxy make mistakes? 
This does not sound very scientific.</title>
<para>
 Actually, it's a black art ;-) And yes, it is always possible to have a broad
 rule accidentally block or change something by mistake. You will almost surely
 run into such situations at some point. It is tricky writing rules to
 cover every conceivable possibility, and not occasionally get false positives.
</para>

<para>
 But this should not be a big concern since the
 <application>Privoxy</application> configuration is very flexible, and
 includes tools to help identify these types of situations so they can be
 addressed as needed, allowing you to customize your installation.
 (<link linkend="badsite">See the Troubleshooting section below</link>.)
</para>

</sect2>


<sect2 renderas="sect3">
<title id="configornot">Will I have to configure Privoxy
 before I can use it?</title>
<para>
 No, not really. The default installation should give you a good starting
 point, and block <emphasis>most</emphasis> unwanted content.
</para>
<para>
 But you will certainly run into situations where there are false positives,
 or ads not being blocked that you may not want to see. In these cases, you
 would certainly benefit by customizing <application>Privoxy's</application>
 configuration to more closely match your individual situation. And we would
 encourage you to do this. This is where the real power of
 <application>Privoxy</application> lies!
</para>
<para>
 You will have to tell your browser about <application>Privoxy</application> 
 (see the Installation section below).
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 renderas="sect3" id="browsers2"><title>My browser does the same things as
Privoxy. Why should I use
Privoxy at all?</title>
 <para>
  Modern browsers do indeed have <emphasis>some</emphasis> of the same
  functionality as <application>Privoxy</application>. Maybe this is
  adequate for you. But <application>Privoxy</application> is much more
  versatile and powerful, and can do a number of things that browsers just can't.
 </para>
 <para>
  In addition, a proxy is good choice if you use multiple browsers, or 
  have a LAN with multiple computers. This way all the configuration 
  is in one place, and you don't have to maintain a similar configuration 
  for possibly many browsers.
 </para>
</sect2>

<sect2 renderas="sect3" id="whytrust"><title>Why should I trust Privoxy?</title>
 <para>
  The most important reason is because you have access to
  <emphasis>everything</emphasis>, and you can control everything. You can
  check every line of every configuration file yourself. You can check every
  last bit of source code should you desire. And even if you can't read code, 
  there should be some comfort in knowing that thousands of other people can, 
  and do read it. You can build the software from scratch, if you want, so
  that you know the executable is clean, and that it is
  <emphasis>yours</emphasis>. In fact, we encourage this level of scrutiny. It
  is one reason we use &my-app; ourselves.
 </para>
</sect2>

<sect2 renderas="sect3" id="license"><title>Is there is a license or fee? What about a 
warranty? Registration?</title>
 <para>
  <application>Privoxy</application> is licensed under the <ulink
  url="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public License (GPL)</ulink>.
  It is free to use, copy, modify or distribute as you wish under the terms of this
  license.  Please see the <link linkend="copyright">Copyright</link> section for more
  information on the license and copyright. Or the <filename>LICENSE</filename> file 
  that should be included.
 </para>
 <para>
  There is <emphasis>no warranty</emphasis> of any kind, expressed, implied or otherwise.
  That is something that would cost real money ;-) There is no registration either.
  <application>Privoxy</application> really is <emphasis>free</emphasis>
  in every respect!
 </para>

</sect2>

<sect2 renderas="sect3" id="spyware">
<title>Can Privoxy remove spyware? Adware? Viruses?</title>
<para>
 No. &my-app; cannot remove anything. It is not a removal tool. It is a
 preventative. &my-app; can help prevent contact from sites 
 that use such tactics with approriate configuration rules, and thus could
 conceivably prevent contamination from such sites.
</para>
</sect2>


<sect2 renderas="sect3" id="otherads">
<title>Can I use Privoxy with other ad-blocking software?</title>
<para>
 &my-app; should work fine with other proxies and other software in general.
</para>
<para>
 But it is probably not necessary to use &my-app; in conjunction with other
 ad-blocking products, and this could conceivably cause undesirable results.
 It would be better to choose one software or the other and work a little to
 tweak its configuration to your liking.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 renderas="sect3" id="jointeam"><title>I would like to help you, what can I do?</title>

<sect3 renderas="sect4" id="jointeam-work"><title>Would you like to participate?</title>
<para>
   Well, we <emphasis>always</emphasis> need help. There is something for
   everybody who wants to help us. We welcome new developers, packagers,
   testers, documentation writers or really anyone with a desire to help in
   any way. You <emphasis>DO NOT</emphasis> need to be a
   <quote>programmer</quote>. There are many other tasks available. In fact,
   the programmers often can't spend as much time programming because of some
   of the other, more mundane things that need to be done, like checking the
   Tracker feedback sections. 
 </para>
 <para>
  So first thing, <ulink
   url="https://sourceforge.net/account/register.php">get an account on SourceForge.net</ulink>
   and mail your id to the <ulink url="mailto:ijbswa-developers@lists.sourceforge.net">developers
   mailing list</ulink>. Then, please read the <ulink
   url="../developer-manual/index.html">Developer's Manual</ulink>, at least
   the pertinent sections.
</para>
<para>
 Once we have added you to the team, you'll have access to the <ulink
 url="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=11118">CVS repository</ulink>, and
 together we'll find a suitable task for you.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 renderas="sect4" id="jointeam-money"><title>Contribute!</title>
<para>
 We, of course, welcome donations and could use money for domain registering,
 buying software to test <application>Privoxy</application> with, and, of course,
 for regular world-wide get-togethers (hahaha). If you enjoy the software and feel
 like helping us with a donation, just <ulink
 url="mailto: ijbswa-developers@lists.sourceforge.net">drop us a note</ulink>.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 renderas="sect4" id="jointeam-software"><title>Software</title>
<para>
 If you are a vendor of a web-related software like a browser, web server
 or proxy, and would like us to ensure that <application>Privoxy</application>
 runs smoothly with your product, you might consider supplying us with a
 copy or license. We can't, however, guarantee that we will fix all potential
 compatibility issues as a result.

<sect2 renderas="sect3" id="whichbrowsers">
<title>Which browsers are supported by Privoxy?</title>
<para>
 Any browser that can be configured to use a proxy, which 
 should be virtually all browsers, including
 <application>Firefox</application>, <application>Internet
 Explorer</application>, and <application>Opera</application> among others.
 Direct browser support is not an absolute requirement since
 <application>Privoxy</application> runs as a separate application and talks
 to the browser in the standardized HTTP protocol, just like a web server
 does.

<sect2 renderas="sect3" id="email-client">
<title>Can I use Privoxy with my email client?</title>
<para>
 As long as there is some way to set a HTTP proxy for the client, then yes,
 any application can be used, whether it is strictly speaking a
 <quote>browser</quote> or not. Though this may not be the best approach for
 dealing with some of the common abuses of HTML in email. See <link
 linkend="outlook">How can I configure <application>Privoxy</application>
 with <application>Outlook Express</application>?</link> below for more on
 this. 
</para>
<para>
 Be aware that HTML email presents a number of unique security and privacy
 related issues, that can require advanced skills to overcome. The developers
 recommend using email clients that can be configured to convert HTML to plain
 text for these reasons.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 renderas="sect3" id="newinstall"><title>Can I install  
 Privoxy over Junkbuster?</title>
 <para>
   We recommend you un-install <application>Junkbuster</application>
   first to minimize conflicts and confusion. You may want to 
   save your old configuration files for future reference. The configuration
   files and syntax have substantially changed, so you will need to manually
   port your old patterns. See the <ulink url="../user-manual/upgradersnote.html">note
   to upgraders</ulink> and <ulink url="../user-manual/installation.html">installation
   chapter</ulink> in the <ulink url="../user-manual/index.html">User Manual</ulink>
   for details.
 </para>
 <para>
  Note: Some installers may automatically un-install
  <application>Junkbuster</application>, if present!
 </para>

</sect2>

<sect2 renderas="sect3">
<title id="firststep">I just installed Privoxy. Is there anything 
special I have to do now?</title>

<para>
 All browsers must be told to use <application>Privoxy</application> 
 as a proxy by specifying the correct proxy address and port number 
 in the appropriate configuration area for the browser. See below.
 You should also flush your browser's memory and disk cache to get rid of any
 cached junk items, and remove any stored 
 <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_cookie">cookies</ulink>.

</para>

</sect2>


<sect2 renderas="sect3" id="localhost"><title>What is the proxy address of Privoxy?</title>
 <para>
  If you set up the <application>Privoxy</application> to run on
  the computer you browse from (rather than your ISP's server or some
  networked computer on a LAN), the proxy will be on <literal>127.0.0.1</literal> 
  (sometimes referred to as <quote>localhost</quote>,
  which is the special name used by every computer on the Internet to refer
  to itself) and the port will be 8118 (unless you have <application>Privoxy</application>
  to run on a different port with the <ulink
  url="../user-manual/config.html#LISTEN-ADDRESS">listen-address</ulink> config option). 
 </para>
 <para>
  When configuring your browser's proxy settings you typically enter
  the word <quote>localhost</quote> or the IP address <quote>127.0.0.1</quote>
  in the boxes next to <quote>HTTP</quote> and <quote>Secure</quote> (HTTPS) and
  then the number <quote>8118</quote> for <quote>port</quote>. 
  This tells your browser to send all web requests to <application>Privoxy</application>
  instead of directly to the Internet.
 </para>
 <para>
  <application>Privoxy</application> can also be used to proxy for 
  a Local Area Network. In this case, your would enter either the IP 
  address of the LAN host where <application>Privoxy</application> 
  is running, or the equivalent hostname. Port assignment would be 
  same as above. Note that <application>Privoxy</application> doesn't
  listen on any LAN interfaces by default.
 </para>
 <para>
  <application>Privoxy</application> does not currently handle
  any other protocols such as FTP, SMTP, IM, IRC, ICQ, etc. Be sure that
  proxying any of these other protocols is not activated.
 </para>
</sect2>

<sect2 renderas="sect3" id="nothing">
<title>I just installed Privoxy, and nothing is happening.
All the ads are there. What's wrong?</title>

<para>
 Did you configure your browser to use <application>Privoxy</application> 
 as a proxy? It does not sound like it. See above. You might also try flushing
 the browser's caches to force a full re-reading of pages. You can verify 
 that <application>Privoxy</application> is running, and your browser 
 is correctly configured by entering the special URL: 
 <ulink url="http://p.p/">http://p.p/</ulink>. 
 <!-- Use http://p.p/ instead of http://config.privoxy.org/ here because
      of potential redirect caching problem (see next Q). -->
 This should take you to a page titled <quote>This is Privoxy..</quote> with
 access to <application>Privoxy's</application> internal configuration.
 If you see this, then you are good to go. If you receive a page saying 
 <quote>Privoxy is not running</quote>, then the browser is not set up to use
 your <application>Privoxy</application> installation.
 If you receive anything else (probably nothing at all), it could either
 be that the browser is not set up correctly, or that
 <application>Privoxy</application> is not running at all. Check the <ulink
 url="../user-manual/config.html#LOGFILE">log file</ulink>. For instructions
 on starting <application>Privoxy</application> and browser configuration,
 see the <ulink url="http://www.privoxy.org/user-manual/startup.html">chapter
 on starting <application>Privoxy</application></ulink> in the
 <ulink url="http://www.privoxy.org/user-manual/">User Manual</ulink>.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 renderas="sect3" id="notused">
<title>I get a <quote>Privoxy is not being used</quote> dummy page although
Privoxy is running and being used.</title>

<para>
 First, make sure that Privoxy is <emphasis>really</emphasis> running and
 being used by visiting <ulink url="http://p.p/">http://p.p/</ulink>. You
 should see the <application>Privoxy</application> main page. If not, see
 the <ulink url="http://www.privoxy.org/user-manual/startup.html">chapter
 on starting <application>Privoxy</application></ulink> in the
 <ulink url="http://www.privoxy.org/user-manual/">User Manual</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
 Now if <ulink url="http://p.p/">http://p.p/</ulink> works for you, but
 other parts of <application>Privoxy</application>'s web interface show
 the dummy page, your browser has cached a redirection it encountered before
 <application>Privoxy</application> was being used. You need to clear your
 browser's cache. Note that shift-reloading the dummy page won't help, since
 that'll only refresh the dummy page, not the redirection that lead you there.
</para>

<para>
 The procedure for clearing the cache varies from browser to browser. For
 example, <application>Mozilla/Netscape</application> users would click 
 <guibutton>Edit</guibutton> --> <guibutton>Preferences</guibutton> -->
 <guibutton>Advanced</guibutton> --> <guibutton>Cache</guibutton> and

 are where various <ulink url="../user-manual/actions-file.html#ACTIONS">actions</ulink>
 that <application>Privoxy</application> could take while processing a certain
 request, are configured. Typically, you would define a set of default actions
 that apply to all URLs, then add exceptions to these defaults where needed.
 There is a wide array of actions available that give the user a high degree
 of control and flexibility on how to process each and every web page.
</para>
 
<para>
 Actions can be defined on a <ulink

 for single URLs, whole web sites, groups or parts thereof etc. Actions can also be
 grouped together and then applied to requests matching one or more patterns.
 There are many possible actions that might apply to any given site. As an example,
 if you are blocking <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_cookie">cookies</ulink>
 as one of your default actions, but need to accept cookies from a given site,
 you would need to define an exception for this site in one of your actions
 files, preferably in <filename>user.action</filename>.

 different purposes: These are 
 <filename>default.action</filename>, the <quote>main</quote> actions file

 <para>

 Filters are a special subset of actions that can be used to modify or

 in the page source (and optionally both client and server headers), including
 HTML tags, and JavaScript. Regular expressions are used to accomplish this.

 your own filters.  This is potentially a very powerful feature, but

 Remember that <link linkend="whatsanad">telling which image is an ad and which

 is rather smart, it can and will make errors. The checkerboard image is visually
 decent, but it shows you that and where images were blocked, which can be very

 erroneously blocked. Some people might also enjoy seeing how many banners

<sect2 renderas="sect3">
<title id="blockedbytext">I see some images being replaced by a text

<para>
 This happens when the banners are not embedded in the HTML code of the
 page itself, but in separate HTML (sub)documents that are loaded into (i)frames
 or (i)layers, and these external HTML documents are blocked. Being non-images
 they get replaced by a substitute HTML page rather than a substitute image,
 which wouldn't work out technically, since the browser expects and accepts
 only HTML when it has requested an HTML document. 
</para>
<para>
 The substitute page adapts to the available space and shows itself as a
 miniature two-liner if loaded into small frames, or full-blown with a
 large red "BLOCKED" banner if space allows.
</para>
<para>
 If you prefer the banners to be blocked by images, you must see to it that
 the HTML documents in which they are embedded are not blocked. Clicking
 the <quote>See why</quote> link offered in the substitute page will show
 you which rule blocked the page. After changing the rule and un-blocking
 the HTML documents, the browser will try to load the actual banner images
 and the usual image blocking will (hopefully!) kick in.

 <ulink

<title>Are all cookies bad? Why?</title>
<para>
 No, in fact there are many beneficial uses of

 method that browsers can use to store data between pages, or between browser
 sessions. Sometimes there is a good reason for this, and the user's life is a
 bit easier as a result. But there is a long history of some websites taking
 advantage of this layer of trust, and using the data they glean from you  and 
 your browsing habits for their own purposes, and maybe to your potential
 detriment. Such sites are using you and storing their data on your system.
 That is why the security conscious watch from whom those cookies come, and why
 they really <emphasis>need</emphasis> to be there.

<sect2 renderas="sect3" id="allow-cookies">

<para>
  There are several actions that relate to cookies. The default behavior is to

has to add extra time to browsing.</title>
<para>
 How much of an impact depends on many things, including the CPU of the host
 system, how aggressive the configuration is, which specific actions are being triggered, 
 the size of the page, etc.
</para>
<para>
 Overall, it should not slow you down any in real terms, and may actually help 
 speed things up since ads, banners and other junk are not typically being
 retrieved and displayed. The actual processing time required by
 <application>Privoxy</application> itself for each page, is relatively small
 in the overall scheme of things, and happens very quickly. This is typically
 more than offset by time saved not downloading and rendering ad images (if ad
 blocking is being used).

<para>
 <quote>Filtering</quote> content via the <literal><ulink
 url="../user-manual/actions-file.html#FILTER">filter</ulink></literal> or
 <literal><ulink
 url="../user-manual/actions-file.html#DEANIMATE-GIFS">deanimate-gifs</ulink></literal>
 actions will certainly cause a perceived slowdown, since the entire document
 needs to be buffered before displaying. And on very large documents, there may be
 some impact. How much depends on the page size, the actual definition of the
 filter(s), etc. See below. Most other actions have little to no impact on
 speed.
</para>

</sect2>


<sect2 renderas="sect3" id="loadingtimes"><title>I notice considerable
delays in page requests compared to the old Junkbuster. What's wrong?</title>
<para>
 If you use any <literal><ulink
 url="../user-manual/actions-file.html#FILTER">filter</ulink></literal> action,
 such as filtering banners by size, web-bugs etc, or the <literal><ulink
 url="../user-manual/actions-file.html#DEANIMATE-GIFS">deanimate-gifs</ulink></literal>
 action, the entire document must be loaded into memory in order for the filtering 
 mechanism to work, and nothing is sent to the browser during this time.
</para>
<para>
 The loading time typically does not really change much in real numbers, but
 the feeling is different, because most browsers are able to start rendering
 incomplete content, giving the user a feeling of "it works". This effect is
 more noticeable on slower dialup connections. Extremely large documents
 may have some impact on the time to load the page where there is filtering
 being done. But overall, the difference should be very minimal. If there is a
 big impact, then probably some other problem is contributing.
 </para>
<para>
 Filtering is automatically disabled for inappropriate MIME types. But note 
 that if the web server mis-reports the MIME type, then content that should
 not be filtered, could be. <application>Privoxy</application> only knows how
 to differentiate filterable content because of the MIME type as reported by
 the server, or because of some configuration setting that enables/disables
 filtering.

</para>

<sect2 renderas="sect3" id="configurl"><title>What are "http://config.privoxy.org/" and

<para>
 <ulink url="http://config.privoxy.org/">http://config.privoxy.org/</ulink> is the
 address of <application>Privoxy</application>'s built-in user interface, and 
 <ulink url="http://p.p/">http://p.p/</ulink> is a shortcut for it.
</para>
<para>
 Since <application>Privoxy</application> sits between your web browser and the Internet, 
 it can simply intercept requests for these addresses and answer them with its built-in
 <quote>web server</quote>.
</para>
<para>
 This also makes for a good test for your browser configuration: If entering the
 URL <ulink url="http://config.privoxy.org/">http://config.privoxy.org/</ulink>
 takes you to a page saying <quote>This is Privoxy ...</quote>, everything is OK.
 If you get a page saying <quote>Privoxy is not working</quote> instead, then
 your browser didn't use <application>Privoxy</application> for the request,
 hence it could not be intercepted, and you have accessed the <emphasis>real</emphasis>
 web site at config.privoxy.org.
</para>
<para>
 With recent versions of <application>Privoxy</application> (version 2.9.x and

 Note that the built-in URLs from earlier versions of <application>Junkbuster</application>

<sect2 renderas="sect3" id="ip"><title>How can I hide my IP address?</title>
<para>
 If you run both the browser and the proxy locally, you cannot hide your IP
 address with <application>Privoxy</application> or ultimately any other
 software. The server needs to know your IP address so that it knows where to
 send the responses back. 
</para>
<para>
 There are many publicly usable "anonymous" proxies out there, which
 provide a further level of indirection between you and the web server.
</para>
<para>
 However, these proxies are called "anonymous" because you don't need
 a password, not because they would offer any real anonymity.
 Most of them will log your IP address and make it available to the
 authorities in case you violate the law of the country they run in. In fact
 you can't even rule out that some of them only exist to *collect* information
 on (those suspicious) people with a more than average preference for privacy.
</para>
<para>
 Your best bet is to chain <application>Privoxy</application>

<title id="anonforsure">Can Privoxy guarantee I am anonymous?</title>
<para>
 No. Your chances of remaining anonymous are greatly improved, but unless you
 <ulink url="#TOR">chain <application>Privoxy</application> with <application>Tor</application></ulink>
 or a similar system and know what you're doing when it comes to configuring
 the rest of your system, it would be safest to assume that everything you do
 on the Web can be traced back to you.
</para>
<para>
 <application>Privoxy</application> can remove various information about you,
 and allows <emphasis>you</emphasis> more freedom  to decide which sites 
 you can trust, and what details you want to reveal. But it neither 
 hides your ip address, nor can it guarantee that the rest of the system
 behaves correctly. There are several possibilities how a web sites can find
 out who you are, even if you are using a strict <application>Privoxy</application>
 configuration and chained it with <application>Tor</application>.
</para>
<para>
 Most of <application>Privoxy's</application> protection can be easily subverted
 by an insecure browser configuration, therefore you should use a browser that can
 be configured to only execute code from trusted sites, and be careful which sites you trust.
 For example there is no point in having <application>Privoxy</application>
 modify the User-Agent header, if websites can get all the information they want
 through JavaScript, ActiveX, Flash, Java etc.
</para>
<para>
 A few browsers disclose the user's email address in certain situations, such
 as when transferring a file by FTP. <application>Privoxy</application>
 does not filter FTP. If you need this feature, or are concerned about the
 mail handler of your browser disclosing your email address, you might
 consider products such as <application>NSClean</application>.
</para>
<para>
 Browsers available only as binaries could use non-standard headers to give
 out any information they can have access to: see the manufacturer's license
 agreement. It's impossible to anticipate and prevent every breach of privacy
 that might occur. The professionally paranoid prefer browsers available as
 source code, because anticipating their behavior is easier. Trust the source,
 Luke!

 Before you configure <application>Privoxy</application> to use <application>Tor</application>

 please follow the User Manual chapters
 <ulink url="../user-manual/installation.html">2. Installation</ulink> and
 <ulink url="../user-manual/startup.html">5. Startup</ulink> to make sure
 <application>Privoxy</application> itself is setup correctly.

 <quote>Tor has successfully opened a circuit</quote> and it
 <quote>looks like client functionality is working</quote>.
</para>
<para>
 If either <application>Tor</application> or <application>Privoxy</application>
 isn't working, their combination most likely will neither. Testing them on their
 own will also help you to direct problem reports to the right audience.
 If <application>Privoxy</application> isn't working, don't bother the
 <application>Tor</application> developers. If <application>Tor</application>
 isn't working, don't send bug reports to the <application>Privoxy</application> Team.
</para>
<para>
 If you verified that <application>Privoxy</application> and <application>Tor</application>
 are working, it is time to connect them. As far as <application>Privoxy</application>
 is concerned, <application>Tor</application> is just another proxy that can be reached
 by socks4 or socks4a. Most likely you are interested in <application>Tor</application>
 to increase your anonymity level, therefore you should use socks4a,
 to make sure <application>Privoxy's</application> DNS requests are
 done through <application>Tor</application> and thus invisible to your local network.
</para>

<![%p-newstuff;[
<para>
 Since <application>Privoxy</application> 3.0.5, its configuration (section 5.2)
 is already prepared for <application>Tor</application>, if you are using a
 default <application>Tor</application> configuration and run it on the same
 system as &my-app;, you just have to uncomment the line:
</para>
<para>
 <screen>
#        forward-socks4a             /     127.0.0.1:9050 .

</para>
<para>
 This is enough to reach the Internet, but additionally you should
 uncomment the following forward rules, to make sure your local network is still
 reachable through Privoxy:
</para>
<para>
 <screen>
#        forward         192.168.*.*/     .
#        forward            10.*.*.*/     .
#        forward           127.*.*.*/     .
 </screen>
</para>
<para>
 Unencrypted connections to systems in these address ranges will
 be as (un)secure as the local network is, but the alternative is
 that you can't reach the network at all.
 If you also want to be able to reach servers in your local
 network by using their names, you will need additional
 exceptions that look like this:

<title id="sitebreak">Might some things break because header information or
content is being altered?</title>

<para>
 Definitely. More and more sites use HTTP header content to decide what to
 display and how to display it. There is many ways that this can be handled, 
 so having hard and fast rules, is tricky.
</para>

<para>
 <quote>User-Agent</quote> in particular is often used in this way to identify
 the browser, and adjust content accordingly. Changing this now (at least not
 further than removing the OS information) is not recommended, since so many
 sites do look for it. You may get undesirable results by changing this.
</para>

<para>
 For instance, different browsers use different encodings of Russian and Czech
 characters, certain web servers convert pages on-the-fly according to the
 User Agent header. Giving a <quote>User Agent</quote> with the wrong
 operating system or browser manufacturer causes some sites in these languages
 to be garbled; Surfers to Eastern European sites should change it to
 something closer. And then some page access counters work by looking at the
 <quote>Referer</quote> header; they may fail or break if unavailable. The
 weather maps of Intellicast have been blocked by their server when no
 <quote>Referer</quote> or cookie is provided, is another example. (But you
 can forge both headers without giving information away). There are
 many other ways things can go wrong when trying to fool a web server.
</para>

<para>
 Similar thoughts apply to modifying JavaScript, and, to a lesser degree,
 HTML elements.
</para>

<para>
 If you have problems with a site, you will have to adjust your configuration 
 accordingly. Cookies are probably the most likely adjustment that may 
 be required, but by no means the only one.

<title id="wasted">I have large empty spaces / a checkerboard pattern now where

<para>
 It would be technically possible eliminate the banners in a way that frees
 their screen estate in many cases, by doing all banner blocking with filters,
 i.e. eliminating the whole image references from the HTML pages instead
 of letting them stay in, and blocking the resulting requests for the
 banners themselves.
</para>
<para>
 But this would consume considerable CPU resources, would likely destroy
 the layout of many web pages which rely on the banners consuming a certain
 amount of screen space, and would fail in other cases, where the screen space
 is reserved e.g. by tables anyway. Also, making the banners disappear without
 a visual trace complicates troubleshooting.

<title id="ssl">How can Privoxy filter Secure (HTTPS) URLs?</title>
<para>
 Since secure HTTP connections are encrypted SSL sessions between your browser

 there is little that <application>Privoxy</application> can do but hand the raw
 gibberish data though from one end to the other unprocessed.
</para>
<para>
 The only exception to this is blocking by host patterns, as the client needs
 to tell <application>Privoxy</application> the name of the remote server,
 so that <application>Privoxy</application> can establish the connection.
 If that name matches a host-only pattern, the connection will be blocked.
</para>
<para>
 As far as ad blocking is concerned, this is less of a restriction than it may
 seem, since ad sources are often identifiable by the host name, and often
 the banners to be placed in an encrypted page come unencrypted nonetheless
 for efficiency reasons, which exposes them to the full power of 
 <application>Privoxy</application>'s ad blocking.

<para>
 There are no known exploits that might affect

 <application>Privoxy</application> can run as a non-privileged 
 user, which is how we recommend it be run. Also, by default 
 <application>Privoxy</application> only listens to requests 
 from <quote>localhost</quote> only. The server aspect of
 <application>Privoxy</application> is not itself directly exposed to the
 Internet in this configuration. If you want to have
 <application>Privoxy</application> serve as a LAN proxy, this will have to
 be opened up to allow for LAN requests. In this case, we'd recommend
 you specify only the LAN gateway address, e.g. 192.168.1.1, in the main 
 <application>Privoxy</application> configuration file and check all <ulink

 options</ulink>. All LAN hosts can then use this as their proxy address
 in the browser proxy configuration, but <application>Privoxy</application>

 A <quote>crunch</quote> simply means <application>Privoxy</application> intercepted

<title>Can Privoxy effect files that I download

<para>
 From the webserver's perspective, there is no difference between
 viewing a document (i.e. a page), and downloading a file. The same is true of
 <application>Privoxy</application>. If there is a match for a <literal><ulink
 url="../user-manual/actions-file.html#BLOCK">block</ulink></literal> pattern,
 it will still be blocked, and of course this is obvious. 
 </para>
 <para>
 Filtering is potentially more of a concern since the results are not always
 so obvious, and the effects of filtering are there whether the file is simply
 viewed, or downloaded. And potentially whether the content is some obnoxious
 advertisement, or Mr. Jimmy's latest/greatest source code jewel. Of course,
 one of these presumably is <quote>bad</quote> content that we don't want, and
 the other is <quote>good</quote> content that we do want.
 <application>Privoxy</application> is blind to the differences, and can only
 distinguish <quote>good from bad</quote> by the configuration parameters
 <emphasis>we</emphasis> give it.
</para>
<para>
 <application>Privoxy</application> knows the differences in files according
 to the <quote>Document Type</quote> as reported by the webserver. If this is
 reported accurately (e.g. <quote>application/zip</quote> for a zip archive),
 then <application>Privoxy</application> knows to ignore these where
 appropriate. <application>Privoxy</application> potentially can filter HTML
 as well as plain text documents, subject to configuration parameters of
 course. Also, documents that are of an unknown type (generally assumed to be
 <quote>text/plain</quote>) can be filtered, as will those that might be
 incorrectly reported by the webserver. If such a file is a downloaded file
 that is intended to be saved to disk, then any content that might have been
 altered by filtering, will be saved too, for these (probably rare) cases.
</para>
<para>
 Note that versions later than 3.0.2 do NOT filter document types reported as 
 <quote>text/plain</quote>. Prior to this, <application>Privoxy</application>
 did filter this document type.
</para>
<para>
 In short, filtering is <quote>ON</quote> if a) the Document Type as reported
 by the webserver is appropriate <emphasis>and</emphasis> b) the configuration
 allows it (or at least does not disallow it). That's it. There is no magic
 cookie anywhere to say this is <quote>good</quote> and this is
 <quote>bad</quote>. It's the configuration that let's it all happen or not.
</para>
<para>
 If you download text files, you probably do not want these to be filtered,
 particularly if the content is source code, or other critical content. Source
 code sometimes might be mistaken for Javascript (i.e. the kind that might
 open a pop-up window). It is recommended to turn off filtering for download
 sites (particularly if the content may be plain text files and you are using
 version 3.0.2 or earlier) in your <filename>user.action</filename> file. And
 also, for any site or page where making <emphasis>any</emphasis> changes at

 One time-tested technique to defeat common ads is to trick the local DNS

 Either <application>Privoxy</application> is not running, or your

 rule, you have a configuration problem or a problem with a host in the 
 forwarding chain.
 
</para>

<para>
 You should verify that &my-app; is indeed running and that the correct port is set,
 and matches what your browser is set to. See <ulink

<title id="flushit">I just added a new rule, but the steenkin ad is 
still getting through. How?</title>
<para>
 If the ad had been displayed before you added its URL, it will probably be
 held in the browser's cache for some time, so it will be displayed without
 the need for any request to the server, and <application>Privoxy</application>
 will not be in the picture. The best thing to do is try flushing the browser's
 caches. And then try again.
</para>

<para>
 If this doesn't help, you probably have an error in the rule you
 applied. Try pasting the full URL of the offending ad into <ulink
 url="http://config.privoxy.org/show-url-info">http://config.privoxy.org/show-url-info</ulink>
 and see if it really matches your new rule. Blocking ads is like blocking
 spam: a lot of tinkering is required to stay ahead of the game.

<title >One of my favorite sites does not work with Privoxy.
What can I do?</title>

<para>
 First verify that it is indeed a <application>Privoxy</application> problem, 
 by toggling off <application>Privoxy</application> through <ulink
 url="http://config.privoxy.org/toggle">http://config.privoxy.org/toggle</ulink>,
 and then shift-reloading the problem page (i.e. holding down the shift key
 while clicking reload. Alternatively, flush your browser's disk and memory
 caches).
</para>

<para>
 If still a problem, go to <ulink
 url="http://config.privoxy.org/show-url-info">http://config.privoxy.org/show-url-info</ulink>
 and paste the full URL of the page in question into the prompt. See which actions
 are being applied to the URL, and which matches in which actions files are
 responsible for that. Now, armed with this information, go to <ulink
 url="http://config.privoxy.org/show-status">http://config.privoxy.org/show-status</ulink>
 and select the appropriate actions files for editing.
</para>
<para>
 You can now either look for a section which disables the actions that
 you suspect to cause the problem and add a pattern for your site there,
 or make up a completely new section for your site. In any case, the recommended
 way is to disable only the prime suspect, reload the problem page, and only
 if the problem persists, disable more and more actions until you have
 identified the culprit. You may or may not want to turn the other actions
 on again. Remember to flush your browser's caches in between any such changes!
</para>
<para>
 Alternately, if you are comfortable with a text editor, you can accomplish 
 the same thing by editing the appropriate actions file. Probably the easiest 
 way to deal with such problems when editing by hand is to add your
 site to a <literal>{ fragile }</literal> section in <filename>user.action</filename>,
 which is an alias that turns off most <quote>dangerous</quote>
 actions, but is also likely to turn off more actions then needed, and thus lower
 your privacy and protection more than necessary,

<sect2 id="dun" renderas="sect3">
<title>After installing Privoxy, I have to log in
every time I start IE. What gives?</title>

<para>
 This is a quirk that effects the installation of
 <application>Privoxy</application>, in conjunction with Internet Explorer and
 Internet Connection Sharing on Windows 2000 and Windows XP. The symptoms may
 appear to be corrupted or invalid DUN settings, or passwords.
</para>

<para>
 When setting up an NT based Windows system with
 <application>Privoxy</application> you may find that things do not seem to be
 doing what you expect. When you set your system up you will probably have set
 up Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) with Dial up Networking (DUN) when
 logged in with administrator privileges. You will probably have made this DUN
 connection available to other accounts that you may have set-up on your
 system. E.g. Mum or Dad sets up the system and makes accounts suitably
 configured for the kids.
</para>

<para>
 When setting up <application>Privoxy</application> in this environment you
 will have to alter the proxy set-up of Internet Explorer (IE) for the
 specific DUN connection on which you wish to use
 <application>Privoxy</application>. When you do this the ICS DUN set-up
 becomes user specific. In this instance you will see no difference if you
 change the DUN connection under the account used to set-up the connection.
 However when you do this from another user you will notice that the DUN
 connection changes to make available to "Me only". You will also find that
 you have to store the password under each different user!
</para>

<para>
 The reason for this is that each user's set-up for IE is user specific. Each
 set-up DUN connection and each LAN connection in IE store the settings for
 each user individually. As such this enforces individual configurations
 rather than common ones. Hence the first time you use a DUN connection after
 re-booting your system it may not perform as you expect, and prompt you for 
 the password. Just set and save the password again and all should be OK.

<title>I cannot connect to any FTP sites. Privoxy

 <para>
  <application>Privoxy</application> cannot act as a proxy for FTP traffic,

  as an FTP proxy. The same is true for <emphasis>any protocol other than HTTP
  or HTTPS (SSL)</emphasis>. 
 </para>
 <para>
  Most browsers understand FTP as well as HTTP. If you connect to a site, with
  a URL like <literal>ftp://ftp.example.com</literal>, your browser is making
  an FTP connection, and not a HTTP connection. So while your browser may 
  speak FTP, <application>Privoxy</application> does not, and cannot proxy 
  such traffic.
 </para>
 <para>
  To complicate matters, some systems may have a generic <quote>proxy</quote>
  setting, which will silently enable various protocols, including
  <emphasis>both</emphasis> HTTP and FTP proxying! So it is possible to
  accidentally enable FTP proxying in these cases. And of course, if this
  happens, <application>Privoxy</application> will indeed cause problems since
  it does not know FTP. <![%p-newstuff;[Newer version will give a sane error

  Chances are that the site suffers from a bug in

  If that works, you may also want to report the problem to the

<title>Why am I getting a 503 Error (WSAECONNREFUSED) on every page?</title>
 <para>
  More than likely this is a problem with your TCP/IP networking. ZoneAlarm has
  been reported to cause this symptom -- even if not running. The solution is
  to either fight the ZA configuration, or uninstall ZoneAlarm, and then find
  something better behaved in its place. Other personal firewall type products

<sect2 renderas="sect3" id="nohostname">
<title>My logs show many <quote>Unable to get my own hostname</quote> lines.

 <application>Privoxy</application> tries to get the hostname of the system

 (from the <filename>config</filename> file
 <emphasis>listen-address</emphasis> setting). If the system cannot supply
 this information, <application>Privoxy</application> logs this condition. 
</para>
<para>
 Typically, this would be considered a minor system configuration error. It is
 not a fatal error to <application>Privoxy</application> however, but may
 result in a much slower response from <application>Privoxy</application> on
 some platforms due to DNS timeouts.

<title>When I try to launch Privoxy, I get an

Why?</title>
<para>
 Port 8118 is <application>Privoxy's</application> default TCP 
 <quote>listening</quote> port. Typically this message would mean that there
 is already one instance of <application>Privoxy</application> running, and
 you are actually trying to start a second <application>Privoxy</application>

 they must be assigned different ports.) How and why this might happen varies

<para>
 This may also be caused by the <quote>demoronizer</quote> filter, 
 in conjunction with a web server that is misreporting a file type. Binary 
 files are exempted from <application>Privoxy's</application> filtering
 (unless the web server by mistake says the file is something else). Either
 upgrade <application>Privoxy</application>, or go to the most recent

<sect2 renderas="sect3" id="demoronizer3">
<title>
 What is the <quote>demoronizer</quote> and why is it there?
</title>
<para>
 The original demoronizer was a Perl script that cleaned up HTML pages which 
 were created with certain Microsoft products. MS has used proprietary extensions 
 to standardized font encodings (ISO 8859-1), which has caused problems for pages
 that are viewed with non-Microsoft products (and are expecting to see a
 standard set of fonts). The demoronizer corrected these errors so the pages
 displayed correctly. <application>Privoxy</application> borrowed from this
 script, introducing a filter based on the original demoronizer, which in turn could
 correct these errors on the fly. 
</para>
<para>
 But this is only needed in some situations, and will cause serious problems in some 
 other situations.
</para>
<para>
 If you are using Microsoft products, you do not need it. If you need to view 
 pages with UTF-8 characters (such as Cyrillic or Chinese), then it will 
 cause corruption of the fonts, and thus <emphasis>should not be on</emphasis>.

 On the other hand, if you use non-Microsoft products, and you occasionally

 <quote>good</quote> code snippets from <quote>bad</quote> code snippets.
</para>
<para>
 If you see this in HTML source, and the page displays without problems, then 
 this is good, and likely some pop-up window was disabled. If you see this 
 where it is causing a problem, such as a downloaded program source code file, 
 then you should set an exception for this site or page such that the
 integrity of the page stays in tact by disabling all filtering.

<title>
 I am getting too many DNS errors like <quote>404 No Such Domain</quote>. Why
 can't Privoxy do this better?
</title>
<para>
 There are potentially several factors here. First of all, the DNS resolution
 is done by the underlying operating system -- not
 <application>Privoxy</application> itself. <application>Privoxy</application>
 merely initiates the process and hands it off, and then later reports
 whatever the outcome was. And tries to give a coherent message if there seems
 to be a problem. In some cases, this might otherwise be mitigated by the
 browser itself which might try some work-arounds and alternate approaches (e.g
 adding <quote>www.</quote> to the URL). In other cases, if
 <application>Privoxy</application> is being chained with another proxy, this
 could complicate the issue, and cause undue
 delays and timeouts. In the case of a <quote>socks4a</quote> proxy, the socks
 server handles all the DNS.  <application>Privoxy</application> would just be
 the <quote>messenger</quote> which is reporting whatever problem occurred
 downstream, and not the root cause of the error.

<sect2 renderas="sect3" id="allcpu">
<title>
 At one site Privoxy just hangs, and starts taking 
 all CPU. Why is this?

<para>
 This is probably a manifestation of the <quote>100% cpu</quote> problem that
 occurs on pages containing many (thousands upon thousands) of blank lines. The blank lines 
 are in the raw HTML source of the page, and the browser just ignores them. But the 
 pattern matching in <application>Privoxy's</application> page filtering
 mechanism is trying to match against absurdly long strings and this becomes
 very CPU-intensive, taking a long, long time to complete. Until a better
 solution comes along, disable filtering on these pages, particularly the
 <literal>js-annoyances</literal> and <literal>unsolicited-popups</literal>

 components such as anti-virus software, spyware protectors, personal
 firewalls or similar components. Try disabling (or uninstalling) these one
 at a time and see if that helps.
