><P
>  <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN

  control and security. Those that have the ability to fine-tune their installation
  will benefit the most. One of <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy's</SPAN
>
  strength's is that it is highly configurable giving you the ability to
  completely personalize your installation. Being familiar with, or at least
  having an interest in learning about <A

  protocols, <A

  will be a big plus and will help you get the most out of <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

  A new installation just includes a very basic configuration. The user 
  should take this as a starting point only, and enhance it as he or she 
  sees fit. In fact, the user is encouraged, and expected to, fine-tune the 
  configuration.

  with a  <A

  But there are areas where configuration is done using a

Privoxy work?</H3
><P
>  A  <A
HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server"
TARGET="_top"
>web proxy</A
>
  is a service, based on a software such as
  <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>, that clients (i.e. browsers) can use
  instead of connecting directly to web servers on the Internet. The
  clients then ask the proxy to fetch the objects they need (web pages,
  images, movies etc) on their behalf, and when the proxy has done so, it
  hands the results back to the client. It is a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"go-between"</SPAN
>. See
  the <A
HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server"
TARGET="_top"
>Wikipedia proxy
  definition</A
> for more.
 </P
><P
>  There are many reasons to use web proxies, such as security (firewalling),
  efficiency (caching) and others, and there are any number of proxies
  to accommodate those needs.
 </P
><P
>  <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> is a proxy that is primarily focused on privacy
  protection, ad and junk elimination and freeing the user from restrictions placed on his 
  activities. Sitting between your browser(s) and the Internet,
  it is in a perfect position to filter outbound personal information that your
  browser is leaking, as well as inbound junk. It uses a variety of techniques to do
  this, all of which are under your complete control via the various configuration
  files and options. Being a proxy also makes it easier to share
  configurations among multiple browsers and/or users.

 <A
HREF="http://www.junkbusters.com/ijb.html"
TARGET="_top"
><SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Internet Junkbuster</SPAN
></A
>, 
 by Anonymous Coders and <A
HREF="http://www.junkbusters.com/"
TARGET="_top"
>Junkbusters
 Corporation</A
>. This saved many users a lot of pain in the early days of
 web advertising and user tracking.</P
><P
> But the web, its protocols and standards, and with it, the techniques for
 forcing  ads on users, give up autonomy over their browsing, and
 for tracking them, keeps evolving. Unfortunately, the <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Internet
 Junkbuster</SPAN
> did not. Version 2.0.2, published in 1998, was 
 (and is) the last official
 <A

TARGET="_top"
>release</A
>
 available from <A
HREF="http://www.junkbusters.com"
TARGET="_top"
>Junkbusters Corporation</A
>.
 Fortunately, it had been released under the GNU
 <A
HREF="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html"
TARGET="_top"
> GPL</A
>, which allowed further
 development by others.</P
><P
> So Stefan Waldherr started maintaining an
 <A
HREF="http://www.waldherr.org/junkbuster/"
TARGET="_top"
>improved version of the
 software</A
>, to which eventually a number of people contributed patches.
 It could already replace banners with a transparent image, and had a first
 version of pop-up killing, but it was still very closely based on the
 original, with all its limitations, such as the lack of HTTP/1.1 support,
 flexible per-site configuration, or content modification. The last release
 from this effort was version 2.0.2-10, published in 2000.</P
><P
> Then, some
 <A
HREF="http://www.privoxy.org/user-manual/copyright.html#AUTHORS"
TARGET="_top"
>developers</A
>
 picked up the thread, and started turning the software inside out, upside down,
 and then reassembled it, adding many
 <A
HREF="http://www.privoxy.org/user-manual/introduction.html#FEATURES"
TARGET="_top"
>new
 features</A
> along the way.</P
><P

 stable version, 3.0, was released August, 2002.

HREF="http://junkbusters.com/"
TARGET="_top"
>Junkbusters Corporation</A

 continues to offer their original version of the <SPAN

 Junkbuster</SPAN

 led to confusion.</P

 There are, however, no objections from Junkbusters Corporation to the 
 <SPAN

 share our ideals and goals.</P

>1.8. How does Privoxy know what is
an ad, and what is not?</H3
><P
> <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN

><P
> First, there are certain patterns in the <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>locations</I
></SPAN
> (URLs)
 of banner images. This applies to both the path (you wouldn't guess how many
 web sites serve their banners from a directory called <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"banners"</SPAN
>!)
 and the host (blocking the big banner hosting services like doublecklick.net
 already helps a lot). <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
> takes advantage of this
 fact by using <A
HREF="../user-manual/actions-file.html#AF-PATTERNS"
TARGET="_top"
>URL
 patterns</A
> to sort out and block the requests for things that sound 
 like they would be ads or banners.</P
><P
> Second, banners tend to come in certain <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>sizes</I
></SPAN
>. But you
 can't tell the size of an image by its URL without downloading it, and if you
 do, it's too late to save bandwidth. Therefore, <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Privoxy</SPAN
>
 also inspects the HTML sources of web pages while they are loaded, and replaces
 references to images with standard banner sizes by dummy references, so that
 your browser doesn't request them anymore in the first place.</P
><P
> Both of this involves a certain amount of guesswork and is, of course, freely
 and readily configurable.</P

This does not sound very scientific.</H3
><P
> Actually, it's a black art ;-) And yes, it is always possible to have a broad
 rule accidentally block or change something by mistake. You will almost surely
 run into such situations at some point. It is tricky writing rules to
 cover every conceivable possibility, and not occasionally get false positives.</P
><P
> But this should not be a big concern since the
 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

 includes tools to help identify these types of situations so they can be
 addressed as needed, allowing you to customize your installation.

 point, and block <SPAN
