   will not work at all. If you are upgrading from a 2.0.x version, you will
   need to port your configuration data to the new format. Note that even the
   pattern syntax has changed! Even configuration files from the 2.9.x versions
   will need to be adapted, as configuration syntax has been very much in flow
   in the 2.9.x series.

 There are many possible actions that might apply to any given site. As an example,
 if you are blocking cookies as one of your default actions, but need to accept

 are being included, to be used for 
 different purposes: These are 
 <TT

 which is actively maintained by the <SPAN

 developers, <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>user.action</TT

 to make their private customizations, and <TT

 decent, but it shows you that and where images were blocked, which can be very

 they get replaced by a substitute HTML page rather than a substitute image,
 which wouldn't work out technically, since the browser expects and accepts
 only HTML when it has requested an HTML document. </P

 miniature two-liner if loaded into small frames, or full-blown with a

 the HTML documents in which they are embedded are not blocked. Clicking
 the <SPAN
