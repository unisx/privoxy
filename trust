#                      Sample Trustfile for Privoxy

# For this file to have any effect, the line in the main config file beginning
# "trustfile" must be uncommented, with the name of this file following the
# word "trustfile".

# Trustfiles are an experimental feature used for building "whitelists"
# of "trusted" sites (versus the usual "blacklists" technique). For more
# detail, see http://www.privoxy.org/user-manual/config.html#TRUSTFILE.

# List trusted domains here. The default is to block any URL that is NOT
# referenced. Access to trusted domains, includes all paths within that
# domain. Preceding a domain with a '+' character, will designate that domain
# as a "trusted referrer", meaning any pages linked from that site will be
# allowed, and then added dynamically to this file. Thus, this builds a
# "white-list" of safe places to browse. Note this means that the file will
# grow with use!

# Preceding the domain with '~' character allows access to that domain only
# (including all paths within that domain). But does not allow access to links
# to other, outside domains. Sites that are added dynamically by trusted 
# referrers, will include the '~' character, as thus do not become trusted
# referrers themselves.

# Example: to allow example.com and links that come from example.com,
# uncomment this line:

#  +example.com 

# and comment the last line (* alone), which would unblock everything:

# *
